# Step 4: Configuration Guide

## Purpose

Transform your AI-generated context into production-ready config files.

## Prerequisites

- Completed Steps 2-3 (Introspection + Positioning)
- Project summaries saved in your AI project
- Local development environment setup

## Part 1: Package Your Config Files

### Install Repomix

Repomix bundles your config files into an AI-friendly format.

```bash
npx repomix
```

````

### What Is Repomix?

A tool that packages directory contents into a single text file for AI
processing.

Learn more: [Repomix GitHub](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix)

### Where to Run It

```bash
cd your-project-root
npx repomix shared/config
```

This creates `repomix-output.txt` containing all your config files.

### Upload to AI Project

1. Open your AI project (same one from Steps 2-3)
2. Upload `repomix-output.txt` to project files
3. The AI will use this to generate completed configs

## Part 2: Generate Config Files

### Update System Prompt

1. Open your AI project settings
2. Replace Step 3 prompt with Step 4 prompt (attached to email)
3. Save changes

### Start New Chat

In your project, start fresh chat and paste:

```
I've completed Steps 2 and 3. I'm ready to configure my landing page.

I've attached my config file structure to the project context.

Please review my project summaries and the config files, then generate completed versions with all placeholders replaced.
```

### What Happens Next

**If gaps exist:** AI asks 5-10 follow-up questions. Answer them.

**If no gaps:** AI immediately generates all completed config files.

### Review Generated Files

- Check voice sounds like YOU (not corporate)
- Verify positioning matches your Step 3 summary
- Note anything that feels off (edit directly after copying)

## Part 3: Copy Files Into Codebase

### 1. Navigate to Config Directory

```bash
cd shared/config
```

### 2. Copy Each File

For each AI-generated file:

1. Open the corresponding file in your codebase (e.g., `2.problem.ts`)
2. Replace entire contents with AI-generated version
3. Save file

### 3. Verify No Placeholder Warnings

Search codebase for `⚠️` to ensure all placeholders are replaced.

```bash
grep -r "⚠️" shared/config
```

Should return no results.

## Part 4: Test Locally

### Start Dev Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Review Each Section

Visit http://localhost:3000 and check:

- ✅ Hero section (headline, description, badge)
- ✅ Problem section (customer profile, pain points)
- ✅ Solution section (outcomes, alternatives)
- ✅ Process section (features, flow steps)
- ✅ Founder section (profile, story)
- ✅ Offer section (Validation Kit details, pricing)
- ✅ Results section (testimonials, case studies)
- ✅ Concerns section (FAQs)

### Make Manual Adjustments

If anything feels off:

1. Edit config files directly in your codebase
2. Save changes
3. Dev server hot-reloads automatically
4. Review again

**Don't regenerate with AI for small tweaks.** Faster to edit directly.

## Part 5: Deploy to Production

### Commit Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Replace placeholders with actual content"
git push origin main
```

### Auto-Deploy

Railway/Vercel will automatically:

1. Detect the push
2. Rebuild your site
3. Deploy to production (~2-3 minutes)

### Verify Live Site

1. Visit your production URL
2. Check all sections load correctly
3. Test on mobile device
4. Verify forms/CTAs work

## Part 6: Custom Domain (If Not Done in Step 1)

If you deployed without a custom domain, now is the time.

**Why now?**

- YouTube feedback video will drive traffic
- Traffic should go to YOUR permanent URL
- Changing domains later breaks links

Follow the Custom Domain Setup section in `guides/step-1-deployment.md`.

## Troubleshooting

**AI says it needs more information:**

- Review your Step 2 + 3 chat summaries
- Answer the specific questions AI asks
- Provide concrete examples (not vague answers)

**Config files don't match my voice:**

- Tell AI: "This sounds too corporate. Here's how I'd say it: [example]"
- OR edit files directly after copying

**TypeScript errors after copying:**

- Check for missing imports
- Verify file structure matches template
- Run `pnpm dev` to see specific errors

**Site looks broken after deploy:**

- Clear browser cache
- Wait 2-5 minutes for build to complete
- Check build logs in provider dashboard

## Next Steps

Once deployed with real content:

1. Submit your live URL via form
2. Book your feedback call slot
3. Prepare any specific questions for the call
4. Wait for calendar invite

**Don't setup analytics or email sequences yet.**
That comes after feedback to avoid rebuilding if positioning changes.
