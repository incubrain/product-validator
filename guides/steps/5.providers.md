**Body:** [Copy from your Email 2 artifact]

**Attachment:** Step 2 system prompt (upload as file)

**Trigger:** Form 1 submission

---

```

## Part 6: Setup Calendar Integration (Form 4)

FilloutForm supports native calendar booking.

**Options:**
1. **FilloutForm Native Calendar** (simplest)
   - Settings → Calendar → Enable

## Part 7: Test End-to-End

Before going live, test the entire sequence with your own email.

**Test checklist:**

- [ ] Submit Form 3 → Email 4 arrives with Step 4 prompt attached
- [ ] Submit Form 4 → Calendar invite received
- [ ] All form submissions recorded in FilloutForm dashboard
- [ ] All emails formatted correctly (no broken links/images)

**If something breaks:**
- Check SMTP connection
- Verify form triggers are active
- Review email template formatting
- Check attachment file sizes (<10MB)

---

## Troubleshooting

**Emails not sending:**

---

## Part 3: Verify Tracking

### Check Script Loads

1. Visit your live site

3. Go to Network tab
4. Look for `script.js` from `cloud.umami.is`
5. Should show `200 OK` status

### Check Events Fire

1. Visit your site
2. Click around (CTAs, nav links, etc.)
3. Go to Umami dashboard
4. Should see real-time visitors

**If nothing shows:**
- Wait 2-5 minutes (can be delayed)
- Check environment variables deployed correctly
- Verify Website ID is correct
- Try incognito window (browser extensions can block)

---

## Part 4: Events to Track

This template pre-tracks these events:

**Automatic events (no setup needed):**
- Page views
- Section views (hero, problem, solution, etc.)
- CTA clicks (primary magnet, secondary direct hire)
- Exit intent triggers
- Modal opens/closes

**Custom events (already configured):**
- `action_click` - Button/link clicks
  - Properties: `location`, `offer_id`, `action`
- `action_view` - Section impressions
  - Properties: `section_id`, `scroll_depth`
- `exit_intent` - Exit intent modal triggered
  - Properties: `trigger_location`, `offer_shown`

**View events in dashboard:**
1. Go to Umami → Your Website
2. Click "Events"
3. See event breakdown by type

---

## Part 5: Key Metrics to Monitor

### Conversion Funnel

**Top of funnel:**
- Visitors/day (goal: 10/day baseline)
- Time on site (goal: >2 minutes)
- Bounce rate (goal: <70%)

**Mid-funnel:**
- Section scroll depth (which sections get attention?)
- CTA view rate (% who scroll to offer section)
- Exit intent trigger rate (% who trigger modal)

**Bottom-funnel:**
- Magnet signup rate (goal: 15-35%)
- Email → Form 1 completion (goal: 40-75%)
- Form 1 → Form 4 completion (goal: 40-75%)
- Form 4 → Paid conversion (goal: 2-5%)

### Traffic Sources

Monitor where visitors come from:
- Direct (typed URL, bookmarks)
- Referral (links from other sites)
- Social (X, LinkedIn, Reddit, etc.)
- Search (organic Google/Bing)

**Early stage focus:** Referral + Social (your guerrilla marketing)

---

## Part 6: Setup Custom Goals (Optional)

Track specific conversion milestones.

**In Umami:**
1. Go to Settings → Goals
2. Add custom goals:
   - **Goal 1:** Magnet signup (event: `action_click`, property: `offer_id=magnet`)
   - **Goal 2:** Deploy confirmed (event: `form_submit`, property: `form_id=form-1`)
   - **Goal 3:** Introspection complete (event: `form_submit`, property: `form_id=form-2`)
   - **Goal 4:** Call booked (event: `form_submit`, property: `form_id=form-4`)

**View goals:**
Dashboard → Goals tab → See conversion rates

---

## Part 7: Create Public Dashboard (Optional)

Share analytics publicly to build trust.

**In Umami:**
1. Go to Settings → Share
2. Enable public sharing
3. Copy share URL
4. Add to `.env`:
   ```bash
   NUXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_LINK="https://cloud.umami.is/share/your-url"
   ```
5. Redeploy

**Footer link:** Automatically appears if `NUXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_LINK` is set.

**Why share publicly?**
- Builds trust (transparent metrics)
- Shows traction (social proof)
- Demonstrates confidence

---

## Part 8: Validate Data Quality

After 7 days of traffic:

**Check for issues:**
- [ ] Event counts match expected volume
- [ ] No duplicate events (same action firing twice)
- [ ] Conversion rates seem reasonable
- [ ] Traffic sources align with marketing efforts
- [ ] No bot traffic inflating numbers

**Common issues:**
- **Too many events:** Check for double-firing (inspect DevTools)
- **Zero events:** Verify script loads, check ad blockers
- **Weird traffic spikes:** Likely bots, filter by user agent

---

## Alternative Providers

### Google Analytics 4 (GA4)

**Pros:** Industry standard, advanced features, free
**Cons:** Complex setup, privacy concerns, overkill for early stage

**Setup:**
1. Create GA4 property
2. Get Measurement ID
3. Update `.env`:
   ```bash
   NUXT_PUBLIC_SCRIPTS_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID="G-XXXXXXXXXX"
   ```
4. Redeploy

### Plausible

**Pros:** Privacy-focused, simple UI, lightweight script
**Cons:** Paid ($9/month), less features than Umami

**Setup:** Similar to Umami, update script URL and site ID

### Fathom

**Pros:** Privacy-first, beautiful UI, unlimited sites
**Cons:** Paid ($14/month), limited event tracking

---

## Troubleshooting

**Events not tracking:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify script loads (Network tab)
- Ensure Website ID matches dashboard
- Try incognito window

**Conversion rates seem wrong:**
- Check for bot traffic (filter by user agent)
- Verify goal configuration
- Compare to FilloutForm submission counts

**Dashboard not updating:**
- Wait 2-5 minutes (can be delayed)
- Clear cache and refresh
- Check if events show in "Real-time" view

---

## Next Steps

After setup:
1. Monitor daily for first week
2. Validate data quality
3. Identify traffic sources working best
4. Iterate on low-performing sections
5. Scale marketing on high-converting channels
