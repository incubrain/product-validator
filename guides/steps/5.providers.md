# Analytics Setup Guide

## Purpose

Track conversions and user behavior on your landing page.

⚠️ **Do this AFTER your feedback call, not before.**

**Why?** Your positioning might change based on feedback. Wait until messaging
is validated.

**Time:** 20-30 minutes **Cost:** Free (recommended providers have generous free
tiers)

## Part 3: Verify Tracking

### Check Script Loads

1. Visit your live site
2. Open browser DevTools (F12)
3. Go to Network tab
4. Look for `script.js` from `cloud.umami.is`
5. Should show `200 OK` status

### Check Events Fire

1. Visit your site
2. Click around (CTAs, nav links, etc.)
3. Go to Umami dashboard
4. Should see real-time visitors

**If nothing shows:**

- Wait 2-5 minutes (can be delayed)
- Check environment variables deployed correctly
- Verify Website ID is correct
- Try incognito window (browser extensions can block)

---

## Part 4: Events to Track

This template pre-tracks these events:

**Automatic events (no setup needed):**

- Page views
- Section views (hero, problem, solution, etc.)
- CTA clicks (primary magnet, secondary direct hire)
- Exit intent triggers
- Modal opens/closes

**Custom events (already configured):**

- `action_click` - Button/link clicks
  - Properties: `location`, `offer_id`, `action`
- `action_view` - Section impressions
  - Properties: `section_id`, `scroll_depth`
- `exit_intent` - Exit intent modal triggered
  - Properties: `trigger_location`, `offer_shown`

**View events in dashboard:**

1. Go to Umami → Your Website
2. Click "Events"
3. See event breakdown by type

---

## Part 5: Key Metrics to Monitor

### Conversion Funnel

**Top of funnel:**

- Visitors/day (goal: 10/day baseline)
- Time on site (goal: >2 minutes)
- Bounce rate (goal: <70%)

**Mid-funnel:**

- Section scroll depth (which sections get attention?)
- CTA view rate (% who scroll to offer section)
- Exit intent trigger rate (% who trigger modal)

**Bottom-funnel:**

- Magnet signup rate (goal: 15-35%)
- Email → Form 1 completion (goal: 40-75%)
- Form 1 → Form 4 completion (goal: 40-75%)
- Form 4 → Paid conversion (goal: 2-5%)

### Traffic Sources

Monitor where visitors come from:

- Direct (typed URL, bookmarks)
- Referral (links from other sites)
- Social (X, LinkedIn, Reddit, etc.)
- Search (organic Google/Bing)

**Early stage focus:** Referral + Social (your guerrilla marketing)

---

## Part 6: Setup Custom Goals (Optional)

Track specific conversion milestones.

**In Umami:**

1. Go to Settings → Goals
2. Add custom goals:
   - **Goal 1:** Magnet signup (event: `action_click`, property:
     `offer_id=magnet`)
   - **Goal 2:** Deploy confirmed (event: `form_submit`, property:
     `formId=form-1`)
   - **Goal 3:** Introspection complete (event: `form_submit`, property:
     `formId=form-2`)
   - **Goal 4:** Call booked (event: `form_submit`, property: `formId=form-4`)

**View goals:** Dashboard → Goals tab → See conversion rates

---

## Part 7: Create Public Dashboard (Optional)

Share analytics publicly to build trust.

**In Umami:**

1. Go to Settings → Share
2. Enable public sharing
3. Copy share URL
4. Add to `.env`:
   ```bash
   NUXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_LINK="https://cloud.umami.is/share/your-url"
   ```
5. Redeploy

**Footer link:** Automatically appears if `NUXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_LINK` is set.

**Why share publicly?**

- Builds trust (transparent metrics)
- Shows traction (social proof)
- Demonstrates confidence

---

## Part 8: Validate Data Quality

After 7 days of traffic:

**Check for issues:**

- [ ] Event counts match expected volume
- [ ] No duplicate events (same action firing twice)
- [ ] Conversion rates seem reasonable
- [ ] Traffic sources align with marketing efforts
- [ ] No bot traffic inflating numbers

**Common issues:**

- **Too many events:** Check for double-firing (inspect DevTools)
- **Zero events:** Verify script loads, check ad blockers
- **Weird traffic spikes:** Likely bots, filter by user agent

---

## Alternative Providers

### Google Analytics 4 (GA4)

**Pros:** Industry standard, advanced features, free **Cons:** Complex setup,
privacy concerns, overkill for early stage

**Setup:**

1. Create GA4 property
2. Get Measurement ID
3. Update `.env`:
   ```bash
   NUXT_PUBLIC_SCRIPTS_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID="G-XXXXXXXXXX"
   ```
4. Redeploy

### Plausible

**Pros:** Privacy-focused, simple UI, lightweight script **Cons:** Paid
($9/month), less features than Umami

**Setup:** Similar to Umami, update script URL and site ID

### Fathom

**Pros:** Privacy-first, beautiful UI, unlimited sites **Cons:** Paid
($14/month), limited event tracking

---

## Troubleshooting

**Events not tracking:**

- Check browser console for errors
- Verify script loads (Network tab)
- Ensure Website ID matches dashboard
- Try incognito window

**Conversion rates seem wrong:**

- Check for bot traffic (filter by user agent)
- Verify goal configuration

**Dashboard not updating:**

- Wait 2-5 minutes (can be delayed)
- Clear cache and refresh
- Check if events show in "Real-time" view

---

## Next Steps

After setup:

1. Monitor daily for first week
2. Validate data quality
3. Identify traffic sources working best
4. Iterate on low-performing sections
5. Scale marketing on high-converting channels
