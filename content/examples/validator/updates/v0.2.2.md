title: Removing Developer Friction
summary:
  One-click deployment, instant HMR, zero configuration. Get live in ~1 minute
  instead of <1 hour.
---

## The Setup Tax

Every minute fighting deployment configs is a minute not validating.

Version 0.2.1 got you live in under an hour.  
Version 0.2.2 gets you live in **~1 minute**.

## One-Click Deployment (Railway + Vercel)

Added pre-configured deployment for the two most founder-friendly platforms:

- **Railway**: Connect repo → deploy → done
- **Vercel**: GitHub integration → automatic edge deployment

Both tested, both work out of the box, both have generous free tiers that handle
validation-phase traffic.

No environment wrangling. No build config debugging. No deployment anxiety.

**Philosophy**: The fastest path from "I have an idea" to "it's live" should be
frictionless.

## HMR That Actually Works

Fixed hot module replacement so config changes don't trigger full page reloads.

**Before**: Edit config → lose scroll position → navigate back → repeat  
**After**: Edit config → hot patch → stay in place → see changes instantly

Built custom Nuxt module for synchronous config loading. Small architectural
fix, massive DX win.

## Direct Data Binding

Eliminated data transformation between config and components.

Offer config now extends component props directly using TypeScript's `Pick`
utility. Type-safe by design. Zero runtime overhead. Breaking changes caught at
compile-time.

**Philosophy**: The best transformation is no transformation.

## Granular Config Structure

Split monolithic files into domain-specific exports:

```bash
2.problem.ts  → solution, customerProfile
3.solution.ts → outcomes, alternatives
4.process.ts  → features, flow
5.founder.ts  → profile, story, business
1.flow.ts     → high-level composition
```

Self-documenting. Clear separation. Easy to navigate.

## Semantic Icon System

Replaced hard-coded strings with semantic aliases:

- `status-available` → green check
- `status-beta` → blue flask
- `status-coming-soon` → orange clock

Change all beta icons by updating one alias. CSS-based styling.

## Why This Matters

This isn't about features. It's about **removing obstacles between "I have an
idea" and "it's live gathering feedback."**

Every deployment fight is time not spent validating.  
Every HMR reload that breaks flow is mental energy wasted.  
Every configuration guess is friction that feeds perfectionist loops.

This release eliminates those obstacles.

## The Pattern

Version 0.2.0: Shifted from template to validation methodology  
Version 0.2.1: Ruthless focus on today's problem only  
Version 0.2.2: Remove technical friction from that focus

Deploy faster. Stay in flow. Validate sooner.

That's the game.
