version: v0.2.2
date: 2025-10-10
title: Ruthless Focus on Today
summary:
  Stripped away complexity, noise, and future-proofing. Only what validates
  today matters.
---

**Philosophy**: Structure reveals intent. If you can't see what belongs where,
the structure is wrong.

---

### **6. Type System Alignment**

Updated all types to match actual data structure. Added `satisfies` to every
export for compile-time validation. Renamed `founder.me` → `founder.profile`
(more semantic).

**Philosophy**: Types should document truth, not aspirations.

---

## Technical Debt Eliminated

- ❌ Async config loading (HMR killer)
- ❌ Heavy data transformation (fragile, verbose)
- ❌ Hard-coded icon strings (maintenance nightmare)
- ❌ Monolithic config files (poor DX)
- ❌ Loose types (runtime surprises)
- ❌ Complex deployment setup (barrier to shipping)

---

## Patterns Established

1. **Build-time module pattern** - Config selection via `process.env`, not
   runtime
2. **Virtual module pattern** - Generate imports at build time for HMR
   compatibility
3. **Direct binding pattern** - Extend component props, don't transform
4. **Semantic alias pattern** - Abstract implementation details behind intent
5. **Granular export pattern** - Small files, clear responsibilities
6. **One-click deployment** - Railway and Vercel configs that just work

---

## Why This Matters

This isn't about adding features. It's about **removing obstacles between "I
have an idea" and "it's live gathering feedback."**

Every deployment configuration you fight with is time not spent validating.  
Every HMR reload that loses your scroll position breaks flow state.  
Every data transformation you debug is energy not spent on messaging.

**This release eliminates those obstacles.**

---

## Developer Experience Wins

**Setup time reduced**: Clone → Deploy → Live in <10 minutes  
**HMR friction removed**: Edit anywhere, stay in flow  
**Type safety enforced**: Catch errors at compile-time, not runtime  
**Config clarity improved**: Self-documenting structure, zero guesswork

---

## Migration Notes

If upgrading from v0.1.0:

1. **Config structure changed** - Review new granular file structure in
   `/config`
2. **Types updated** - Run `pnpm typecheck` to catch breaking changes
3. **Icon aliases added** - Replace hard-coded icon strings with semantic
   aliases
4. **Deployment simplified** - Check Railway/Vercel config examples

Breaking changes are intentional. Better to fix architecture now than accumulate
debt.

---

## What Hasn't Changed

The core philosophy remains:

- You are your own customer
- Ship signal, not perfection
- Validation before building
- Break perfectionist paralysis through forced deployment

This release just makes that philosophy easier to execute.

---

## Next Focus

- Component-level optimizations (reduce prop drilling)
- Validation framework (catch misconfigurations early)
- Documentation automation (types → docs)

---

**Key Insight**: The goal isn't "making it work." It's "making complexity
disappear so you can focus on what matters: validation."

**Target market remains**: The struggling founder. 3-10+ years trying to build.
Stuck in mental loops. Knows they're capable but can't break through.

This update removes the technical friction that feeds those loops.

Deploy faster. Validate faster. Decide faster.

That's the game.
