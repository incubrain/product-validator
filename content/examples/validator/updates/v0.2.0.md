title: From Template to Validation System
summary:
  Shifted from "how do I make this look good?" to "what evidence do I need to
  decide?"

## The Core Problem

Most founders (including me) confuse "looking professional" with "being ready to
validate."

Design becomes a procrastination tool. "Just one more iteration on the hero
section..." while the real question—**does anyone want this?**—goes unanswered.

Version 0.1 was a landing page template.  
Version 0.2 is a **validation methodology** that happens to include a template.

## Why Competitors Miss This

Platforms like ClickFunnels, Unbounce, Leadpages—they skip validation and push
you straight to market.

**Their business model:**

1. Monthly subscriptions (whether you succeed or fail)
2. Sales commissions (the faster you sell, the faster they profit)

They're incentivized to get you selling _immediately_, not validating
_correctly_.

They're not bad tools. They're just solving a different problem: "How do we
scale revenue?" not "Should we build this?"

**This template is the headless version of those platforms—for the stages they
neglect.**

We don't help you scale. We help you _decide if you should_.

## The Data Structure Advantage

This isn't just a template. It's a structured framework for product ideation.

Eight config files guide you through:

- Problem definition
- Solution articulation
- Process clarity
- Value positioning
- Objection handling

Each section asks the right questions in the right order. You're not just
"filling in content"—you're **clarifying your thinking** in a way that produces
validation-ready messaging.

## Product Model Evolution

Original model: Four product tiers (magnet/low/mid/high) all mapped upfront.

**New model:**

1. Free magnet → validate interest
2. Low-ticket ($50-100) → validate willingness to pay
3. Mid/high-ticket → only after low-ticket proves demand

Philosophy: Don't build the ladder until you prove people want to climb.

## Why This Matters

Validation isn't about features. It's about **forcing yourself to think clearly
before building**.

The template structure itself prevents premature optimization. You can't skip to
monetization. You can't jump to scale. The flow is fixed: validate first, build
second.
