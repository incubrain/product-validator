version: v0.2.0
date: 2025-09-21
title: From Template to Validation System
summary:
  Shifted focus from “how it looks” to “what evidence we need to decide.”
  Reframed the product as a validation methodology that uses a template as its
  delivery vehicle.

## Core Problem

Founders often confuse polish with readiness.  
Tuning a hero section feels productive — but it doesn't answer the real
question: **does anyone want this?**

Version 0.1 = landing page template.  
Version 0.2 = a validation methodology that happens to include a template.

## Strategic Shift: Decision Before Design

We stopped treating the template as an end product and started treating it as an
**experiment platform**. The goal is not to make things look perfect — it’s to
produce the evidence founders need to make build/no-build decisions.

**Decision:** Prioritize measurable signals (traffic, signups, completion,
payment intent) over UI polish.

## Why Competitors Miss the Point

Established page-builders optimize for revenue generation and retention (their
customers are the platform owners). They push getting to revenue fast — not
necessarily validating demand correctly.

**Our position:** We are a headless validation system. We help founders decide
_if_ they should build, not just _how_ to sell faster.

---

## Structure as a Productive Constraint

We turned the template into a structured framework that forces clarity:

- Each config section corresponds to a validation question (problem → solution →
  process → offers → objections).
- The order of content is deliberate: you can’t skip to monetization until
  you’ve proven attention → conversion → engagement → demand.

**Purpose:** Structure focus. The template makes founders answer the right
questions in the right order.

## Evolved Product Model

We moved away from “build all the tiers up-front.” Instead:

1. **Free magnet** — validate interest (email for value).
2. **Low-ticket** — validate willingness to pay.
3. **Mid/high-ticket** — only after lower tiers demonstrate demand.

**Principle:** Don’t build the ladder until you know people want to climb.

## Why This Matters

This release reframes success metrics for early-stage work: clarity, evidence,
and decision quality.  
Instead of shipping features that make you feel busy, we help you gather the
signals that let you act with confidence.

**Outcome:** Fewer wasted builds, faster learning loops, better decisions about
what to build next.
