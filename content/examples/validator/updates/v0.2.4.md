title: Minimum Viable Idea → Methodology Section Architecture
summary: Reframed validation from MVP to MVI. Built universal data structure for success measurement. Separated product-agnostic template from validator-specific methodology.

## Core Realization: Minimum Viable Idea (MVI)

**Traditional approach:** Build MVP → Test → Pivot → Rebuild

**Our approach:** Package idea → Test demand → Refine based on feedback → Build validated version

### Why MVI > MVP

You don't need the lead magnet to validate the magnet idea.

**Smoke testing reimagined:**
- Test positioning before creation
- A/B test multiple magnet concepts
- Gather feedback to refine offer
- Build only what's validated

**Example:** Instead of spending 15-30 hours creating a workbook, test the concept with a landing page describing what it would contain. If 5% signup vs 20%, you've saved weeks on a weak idea.

**Result:** More refined product from day one. No wasted effort on magnets nobody wants.

## Methodology Section Architecture

### The Challenge

We built validation benchmarks + decision frameworks for our product (Product Validator). But these felt too specific—pickle grandma doesn't need "magnet conversion rates."

---

## Technical Decisions

### Integration Points

**Validation examples** embedded in Solution section:
- Proves validation methodology works
- Shows Buffer/Dropbox/Videofruit success stories
- Social proof at point of consideration

**Methodology section** placed after Process:
```
Process (how to validate) → Methodology (how to measure) → Founder → Offer
```

Logical flow: Learn the process, understand success criteria, meet the founder, see the offer.

### Data Structure

**New types added:**
```typescript
ValidationExample     // Company case studies
SuccessMetric        // Measurement thresholds
DecisionOption       // Build/Refine/Pivot rules
MethodologyFramework // Complete measurement system
```

**Type safety:** All methodology content now type-checked. No hardcoded strings in components.

---

## Design Principles Reinforced

### 1. Product-Agnostic Base Template

Universal structure works for any business:
- Personal trainers show client transformations
- Pickle grandma shows customer testimonials
- We show validation case studies

Same structure, different content.

### 2. Optional Extensions

Methodology section is optional. Users include it if relevant, skip if not.

### 3. Example-Driven Development

`examples/validator/` contains our full config. Base template stays minimum. Other founders reference our example, customize their own.

### 4. Separation of Concerns

**Template** = Structure + components  
**Config** = Content + data  
**Examples** = Reference implementations

Keep them decoupled. Reduce maintenance overhead.

## What I'm Testing

### MVI Hypothesis

Can we validate magnet concepts without building magnets?

If positioning test shows weak interest (5% signup), does that predict magnet completion failure?

**Thesis:** Test idea → Refine based on feedback → Build validated version = higher success rate + less wasted effort.

### Methodology Placement

Does showing benchmarks *after* process create better understanding than showing them *before*?

**Current flow:** Learn how to validate → See success criteria → Execute with confidence

vs.

**Alternative:** See success criteria → Learn how to validate → Risk information overload

Testing which creates better comprehension and execution.

## What's Next

### Phase 2: Post-Validation Support

After founders validate demand, they need:
- Productization guidance (build delivery system)
- Traffic scaling strategies
- Conversion optimization

**Status:** Not building yet. Validate Phase 1 first.

### Potential: MVI Testing Framework

Tool to A/B test multiple magnet concepts simultaneously:
- Deploy 3 landing pages with different positioning
- Track which generates highest interest
- Build only the winner

**Status:** Conceptual. Might build after validating core template.

---

## Status

**Live:** Methodology section deployed to validator example.

**Testing:** Does separating universal template from specific methodology reduce confusion?

**Hypothesis:** Founders adapt base template to their needs. Validator example shows one way to extend it.

Early signal: Clear distinction between "template" and "example implementation."

Exactly what I want.
