title: Validation Flow Redesign → Attention-to-Build Framework
summary:
  Major overhaul of the validation framework introducing five clear stages —
  Attention, Conversion, Engagement, Demand, and Build — to guide users through
  measurable milestones from traffic to validated product readiness.

## Core Realization: Stage-Based Validation Framework

The new validation system replaces abstract funnel steps with a **five-stage
progression** that mirrors a founder’s real journey from gaining attention to
building a validated product. Each stage is designed to help template users
focus on solving one specific problem at a time — and to measure their success
with data-driven thresholds.

### The Five Stages

#### **Stage 1: Capture Attention**

- **Goal:** Can you get attention and drive it to your site?
- **Focus:** Traffic generation + message continuity. Visitors should
  immediately recognize the promise from your outreach or posts.
- **Metrics:** Daily visitors and bounce rate.
- **Signal:** If users bounce instantly, your message and your page aren’t
  aligned.

**Objective:** Prove message continuity. Once your bounce rate stabilizes and
traffic grows steadily (>30 visitors/day with <60% bounce), you’re ready for
Stage 2.

#### **Stage 2: Convert to Leads**

- **Goal:** Capture interest through a **fake door** offer.
- **Focus:** Validate whether visitors are willing to exchange contact details
  for value.
- **Metrics:** Email capture rate (target >15%).
- **Outcome:** A strong signal that the offer resonates — even if the magnet
  isn’t built yet.

#### **Stage 3: Validate Engagement**

- **Goal:** Deliver the promised magnet and measure engagement.
- **Focus:** Is the content valuable enough for people to complete it?
- **Metrics:** Completion rate (>40% = strong). Gather qualitative feedback
  through follow-ups.

#### **Stage 4: Validate Demand**

- **Goal:** Present your offer and measure **purchase intent**.
- **Focus:** Can you turn engagement into real business signals?
- **Metrics:** Expressed purchase interest rate (>20% = strong signal). Use this
  to refine pricing and positioning.

#### **Stage 5: Build Prep**

- **Goal:** Plan the validated product and refine the funnel.
- **Focus:** Integrate testimonials, optimize conversions, add media, and
  connect to providers so you're ready to start building.
- **Metrics:** Full-funnel conversion rate (>3% = validated). Incorporate all
  feedback gathered in prior stages.

## Purpose & Philosophy

Each stage isolates a single variable — attention, conversion, engagement,
demand, or build — so founders can measure progress with precision.  
The sequence ensures users **don’t skip ahead** to building before validating
real demand.

**Why this matters:**

- Establishes a universal benchmark for progress.
- Reduces confusion by aligning UX, copy, and measurement.
- Promotes founder focus on one measurable problem per stage.

## System Integration

The `useSectionVisibility` composable now powers dynamic visibility for every
section based on the active validation stage. This ensures users only see the
sections relevant to where they are in the flow.

**Logic overview:**

- Each section defines `minStage` (e.g., `'attention'`, `'conversion'`,
  `'demand'`).
- `show(sectionKey)` compares current stage level to required threshold.
- As users progress, new sections become visible automatically — e.g., Founder
  section unlocks at **Engagement**, Results unlock at **Build**.

This design helps users visually experience progression, reinforcing that
validation is a structured, staged process rather than a single event.

## Metrics-Driven Thresholds

Each step includes explicit success bands (weak / average / strong) so founders
know when to move forward:

- **Attention:** Daily traffic >30, bounce rate <60%.
- **Conversion:** Email capture rate >15%.
- **Engagement:** Magnet completion rate >40%.
- **Demand:** Purchase intent >20%.
- **Build:** Funnel conversion >3%.

These metrics act as **gates** — clear signals to advance or refine before
scaling.

## Founder Benefit

This framework turns validation from an abstract process into a measurable
pathway. It teaches founders how to:

- Recognize what “validated” actually means at each step.
- Gather and interpret behavioral data instead of opinions.
- Make confident build/no-build decisions with evidence.

## Secondary Updates (Summarized)

### 1. **Privacy-First Refinement**

Encrypted email capture retained with KV storage + hashing for deduplication.
Maintains privacy while supporting intent tracking.

### 2. **Section Visibility Improvements**

All sections updated to align with new `ValidationStage` enum. Visibility logic
unified and tested.

### 3. **Config Consolidation**

Reduced domain configs from 8 → 7. Merged `problem.ts` + `solution.ts` into
`problem-solution.ts` for clarity.

### 4. **UX Polish**

Improved stage intro texts, CTA alignment, and contextual bridges between
sections (e.g., problem → offer, concerns → offer).

## Status

**Live:** Five-stage validation framework deployed with dynamic visibility
logic.  
**Testing:** Bounce rate reduction and fake-door conversion rate accuracy.  
**Hypothesis:** Sequential problem-solving and staged metrics create faster,
more confident validation cycles.

**Outcome goal:** Help founders know _exactly_ when they’re ready to build.
