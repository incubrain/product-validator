summary:
  Stripped away complexity, noise, and future-proofing. Only what validates
  today matters.

## The Validation Lifecycle

**Launch → Validate** → _(Monetize → Optimize → Scale)_

Everything in brackets is tomorrow's problem. Until you validate demand,
monetization strategy is theoretical. Optimization is premature. Scale is
irrelevant.

This template forces you to solve today's problem: **Does anyone want this?**

## Removed Paid Product Complexity

Original template included three paid tiers (low/mid/high-ticket). All removed
from initial launch.

**Why?** You're building a ladder before proving people want to climb. Ship the
free magnet first. Gather real feedback. _Then_ build the paid offer based on
actual pain points—not assumptions about what "might" work.

The flow is: Launch → Validate → Decide what to build.

Not: Theorize → Build everything → Hope it works.

## Noise & Friction Elimination

Every element that adds cognitive load got cut:

- **Videos removed from requirements** — Production is time-intensive and blocks
  launch. Ship text + images. Add video polish after validation proves the
  messaging works.
- **Multi-column responsive layouts** — Killed complexity. Everything stacks
  vertically on mobile. If it works on the smallest screen, it works everywhere.
- **Design optimization** — Not a Day 1 priority. Good enough is enough. Perfect
  is the enemy of shipped.

**The principle:** Complexity compounds. A decision to create multi-column
sections means scaling across breakpoints. Focus on mobile-first single column?
Minimal work, universal compatibility.

Small decisions like orientation, image placement, video inclusion—these add
friction without meaningful validation value. Until you know what converts,
you're guessing.

## Copy Over Everything Else

Writing copy forces clarity. You can't articulate value if you don't understand
it yourself.

Copy is:

- Easy to write
- Easy to change
- High-return investment (helps you _think_)

Design, videos, imagery—these are optimization tasks. They matter _after_ you
prove the message resonates. Before validation, they're distractions that sink
ships before they reach the ocean.

**Design is a trap.** People obsess over looks when messaging is the real
blocker. If someone doesn't resonate with your product, it's not the design—it's
unclear value communication.

You need good copy to get to good design. Not the other way around.

## The Philosophy Shift

Stop solving tomorrow's problems. Be _aware_ of the future, but don't build for
it yet.

Launch → Validate → Decide → Monetize/Pivot.

In that order. Always.
