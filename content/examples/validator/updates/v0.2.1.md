  Cut every ounce of complexity that doesn't validate demand. No

## The Core Principle: Validate Before You Build

**Launch → Validate** → _(Monetize → Optimize → Scale)_

Everything beyond validation is tomorrow’s problem.  
Until someone proves they want what you’re offering, monetization is fantasy,
optimization is waste, and scaling is delusion.

This release is a hard reset toward what matters most:

> **Does anyone actually want this?**

## Stripping Out False Priorities

### Removed Paid Product Tiers

The template originally included multiple pricing tiers. They’re gone.

You don’t need pricing strategy before you have proof of interest.  
**First earn attention. Then validate intent. Then decide what to sell.**

Building monetization ladders before validation is how founders build castles on
sand.

### Removed Launch Blockers

Every feature that delayed testing or added creative pressure has been cut.

- **No mandatory videos:** Production kills momentum. Ship text and images
  first.
- **No multi-column layouts:** Mobile-first simplicity guarantees focus and
  compatibility.
- **No “perfect” design loops:** Polish only what the data proves is working.

**Philosophy:** If it doesn’t directly improve validation, it’s vanity.

## The Copy-First Doctrine

Words are the fastest path to truth.  
Copy reveals whether your value proposition lands — and forces you to understand
it yourself.

**Copy is validation.**  
Design, media, and layout are decoration until you know the message works.

> You don’t design your way to clarity.  
> You write your way to it.

## The Operating Mindset

Stop building for what might happen. Build for what’s true today.

**Order of operations:**

1. Launch
2. Validate
3. Decide
4. Monetize or Pivot

Anything else is noise disguised as progress.

**Focus:** Today’s problem only — _prove demand exists._
