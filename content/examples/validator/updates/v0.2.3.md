title: Workbooks → AI Conversations
summary: Replaced static PDFs with intelligent dialogue. Depth through conversation, not forms.

## Why The Change

Founders don't finish workbooks. They skim, give surface answers, never complete them.

**New approach:** AI conversations that probe, challenge, and force breakthroughs.

## What Changed

### **Email 2: Deep Introspection**
45-90 min AI conversation extracting:
- Domain expertise
- Expensive pain points solved
- Target customer (past-self)
- Unique positioning

AI challenges vague answers. Gives permission for 5-20 min thinking breaks. Forces depth.

### **Email 3: Positioning + Offer**
70-90 min single conversation:
- AI conducts competitive research
- Validates unique positioning
- Packages offer structure

One conversation keeps momentum vs switching contexts.

### **Email 4: Configuration**
AI reads project context + config files → generates completed landing page → founder deploys.

**Key shift:** Technical details moved to repo guides. Emails stay high-level. Less maintenance overhead.

---

## Design Principle

**Separation of concerns:**
- Emails = process + motivation (rarely change)
- System prompts = AI behavior (rarely change)  
- Repo guides = technical commands (change frequently)

Keep them separated. Reduce maintenance debt.

## What I'm Testing

Can AI conversations produce better introspection than workbooks?

Will founders tolerate 2-3 hour conversations if they get breakthrough value?

Early signal: "This felt like therapy" and "I've been avoiding these questions for years."

Exactly what I want.
