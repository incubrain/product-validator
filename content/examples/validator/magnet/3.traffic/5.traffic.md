# Driving Traffic: Become Human & Make Friends

## Why This Matters

Without traffic, you have no validation data. Without data, you're guessing.

**Goal:** 10-30 daily visitors consistently for 1-2 weeks.

This isn't about going viral. It's about proving that real people care enough to
click and stay (bounce rate <70%).

**Critical mindset shift:** Marketing isn't broadcasting. It's making friends
who have the same problems you solved.

## The Core Strategy: Human-First Marketing

Forget growth hacks. Forget "10X your traffic in 10 minutes."

**The truth:** Sustainable traffic comes from genuine human connections.

**The approach:**

- Pick ONE platform (95% of your effort)
- Make friends, not followers
- Be authentic, vulnerable, and helpful
- Repurpose strategically to 1-2 other platforms
- Scale to more channels only AFTER product launch + bandwidth

**Why one platform?** Consistency beats spreading thin. Better to be known in
one community than invisible in five.

## Evergreen Principles

### Volume & Consistency

**Reality check:** This takes 4+ hours per day minimum.

- Small daily actions compound over weeks
- Consistency beats cleverness every time
- Cut back only if exceeding 30 visitors/day by large margin
- If you can't commit 4 hours/day → validation will take 3-4x longer

**Philosophy:** Ship fast, market hard, validate with data.

### Direct Outreach & Relationship Building

**The "100 List" Method:**

Identify 100 people in your niche or surrounding space who:

- Are in your target market or adjacent
- Have engaged audiences (not just follower counts)
- Post content relevant to your ideal customer

**What you do with your list:**

- Learn from them (what they post, what resonates)
- Reply to their posts thoughtfully (add value, not "great post!")
- Mention them in your posts (give credit, amplify their work)
- DM people interacting with their posts (genuine connection, not pitching)

**Goal:** Make friends, not extract value.

Some will become customers. Most will amplify your message because they know and
trust you.

### Strategic Community Targeting

Find pockets where your target market already hangs out:

- Chat groups (Discord, Slack, Telegram)
- Reddit threads (niche subreddits)
- Forums (Indie Hackers, specific industry communities)
- Facebook/LinkedIn groups

**Approach:**

- Join and lurk (learn norms, read rules)
- Contribute value for 1 week before mentioning your product
- Share resources, answer questions, be helpful
- Subtle mentions only: "PS: I built [tool] for this if helpful"

**Failure mode:** Jumping in with self-promotion = instant ban and reputation
damage.

### Authenticity & Vulnerability

**Be human:**

- Share failures openly (builds trust faster than wins)
- Ask for help (people love helping)
- Be specific in your struggles (generic posts get ignored)
- Respond to every reply (shows you care)

**Example of authentic vs. promotional:**

**Promotional (bad):** "Just launched my new productivity app! Check it out:
[link]"

**Authentic (good):** "Spent 3 hours yesterday stuck on auth integration for my
side project. Finally figured it out by simplifying the flow. If you're building
apps, what's your biggest backend pain?"

The second approach starts conversations. Conversations lead to relationships.
Relationships lead to traffic.

## What You'll Do

### Step 1: Pick Your Platform (30 min)

**Decision framework:** Where does your past self (from Step 2) hang out?

**Platform guide:**

| Your Target Market                            | Primary Platform           | Why                          |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Developers / Tech builders                    | Twitter/X or Hacker News   | Dev community is active here |
| Creative / Content creators                   | Twitter/X or Discord       | Strong creative communities  |
| Niche professionals (teachers, lawyers, etc.) | Reddit or LinkedIn         | Industry-specific groups     |
| Educators / Freelancers                       | Reddit or Facebook Groups  | Community-focused            |
| Entrepreneurs / Founders                      | Twitter/X or Indie Hackers | Startup/founder ecosystem    |

**Your task:**

- Pick ONE platform for 95% of effort
- Identify 1-2 others for strategic repurposing (10-15 min/day max)
- Commit to your primary for at least 2 weeks before switching

### Step 2: Build Your "100 List" (1 hour)

Create a spreadsheet with these columns:

- Name
- Handle/Username
- Platform
- Content themes (what they post about)
- Engagement level (how active their audience is)
- Notes (why they're relevant to your target market)

**How to find your 100:**

1. Search your platform for keywords related to your problem space
2. Look at who's engaging with those posts
3. Check their profiles — do they have your target audience?
4. Add them to your list

**Quality over quantity:** 50 highly relevant people > 100 random accounts.

This list becomes your daily engagement source for the next 1-2 weeks.

### Step 3: Daily Engagement Routine (4+ hours/day)

**Morning (2 hours):**

**9:00-9:30am: Scan your "100 List"**

- Check latest posts from your list
- Identify 10-15 posts you can add value to
- Note: Don't just reply to everything — pick where you have genuine insight

**9:30-10:30am: Thoughtful replies**

- Reply to those 10-15 posts with substance
- Add value: share experience, ask thoughtful question, offer resource
- Avoid generic comments ("Great post!" "So true!")
- Reference their content specifically

**10:30-11:00am: Create 1 original post**

- Share an insight from your building process
- Ask a question related to your problem space
- Be vulnerable about a struggle
- **Include your hook/link only if naturally relevant**

**Afternoon (1 hour):**

**2:00-2:30pm: Respond to engagement**

- Reply to everyone who commented on your post
- Continue conversations (don't just say "thanks")
- Be present and engaged

**2:30-3:00pm: Direct outreach**

- DM 3-5 people who engaged with your "100 List" posts
- Be genuine: "Saw your comment on [person]'s post about [topic]. I've been
  thinking about that too. [Specific insight or question]."
- DO NOT pitch your product in first message
- Goal: Start a conversation

**Evening (1 hour):**

**5:00-5:30pm: Community posting**

- Post in 1-2 strategic communities (Reddit, Discord, Slack)
- Share a resource or answer a question
- Mention your product only if directly relevant

**5:30-6:00pm: Community engagement**

- Respond to replies on your community posts
- Engage in other discussions (not just your own threads)
- Build reputation as helpful member

### Step 4: Strategic Community Infiltration (Ongoing)

**Target:** 3-5 communities where your customers hang out

**Week 1: Lurk & Learn**

- Join communities
- Read rules and guidelines
- Observe what gets engagement
- Note the tone and norms
- DO NOT POST YET

**Week 2: Contribute Value**

- Answer questions where you have expertise
- Share free resources (templates, guides, tips)
- Compliment others' work
- Still no product promotion

**Week 3+: Subtle Mentions**

- Continue being helpful
- When relevant, mention your product as "PS: Built [tool] for this"
- Link only when it genuinely solves the problem being discussed
- Let others discover and share your work

## Time Commitment Reality Check

**This is 4+ hours per day.**

Not 15 minutes. Not "when you have time." Four dedicated hours minimum.

**Why so much time?**

- Building relationships takes volume
- Algorithms reward consistency
- Your "100 List" needs daily engagement to stay effective
- One-off posts don't build momentum

**When to scale back:**

- Consistently exceeding 30 visitors/day
- Bounce rate below 60%
- Need to focus on next validation stage

**If you can't commit 4 hours/day:**

- Validation will take 3-4 months instead of 1-2 weeks
- Consider if this is the right time to validate
- Or adjust expectations for timeline

## Success Criteria

✅ **10-30 daily visitors sustained for 1-2 weeks**  
✅ **Bounce rate under 70%**  
✅ **Traffic coming from 2-3 reliable sources**  
✅ **"100 List" built and engaged daily**  
✅ **4+ hours/day commitment maintained**  
✅ **Genuine conversations started** (not just broadcasts)

**What "success" looks like:**

- People reply to your posts with "I have this exact problem"
- DMs from people asking questions about your solution
- Community members start mentioning you in their posts
- Traffic is consistent (not just launch spikes)

## Decision Point

**If you hit 10-30/day with <70% bounce rate:**  
→ **Move to Stage 2 (Conversion)**  
You've validated attention. Time to optimize signups.

**If you're under 10/day after 2 weeks:**  
→ **Double down on volume or test new communities**

- Are you actually doing 4 hours/day?
- Is your "100 List" the right people?
- Are you being authentic or promotional?
- Try different communities or platform

**If bounce rate is >70%:**  
→ **Message-market fit issue**

- Your hook doesn't resonate (go back to Step 3)
- Wrong audience (revisit Step 2: who is your past self?)
- Landing page is confusing (simplify)

**If you're exceeding 50/day consistently:**  
→ **Maintain momentum, start Stage 2 prep**  
You've found product-market fit for attention. Scale carefully while optimizing
next stage.

## What's Next

Once you have consistent attention validated (10-30/day, <70% bounce), optimize
for email capture (Stage 2: Conversion).

You now have:

1. Traffic flowing consistently
2. Validation that people care (they're clicking)
3. Early signal of message-market fit (low bounce rate)
4. Relationships building in communities

This is your foundation. Stage 2 turns visitors into leads.

**Time investment:** 4+ hours/day for 1-2 weeks  
**Key metric:** 10-30 daily visitors + <70% bounce rate  
**Core principle:** Make friends, not broadcasts — genuine connections drive
sustainable traffic

# Ideas

- this is too specific, no need to schedule etc, give them daily targets instead
- Need to link this to our 100 tribe list from previous stage, remove creation
  step from this document.
- 'Traffic' isn't a good title for this step - we should be focussing on
  'Networking' and 'Speaking' now that we have our voice and our audience (100
  list) - traffic is a byproduct
