This framework guides you through six critical stages—from understanding
yourself as a founder to preparing for confident execution. Each stage builds on
the last, ensuring you validate demand before investing months in development.

## Why This Framework Works

Most founders fail not because they can't build—but because they build the wrong
thing. This system forces you to:

- **Validate identity first** — Build from your unique strengths and values
- **Prove attention** — Get people to care before you build
- **Measure conversion** — Confirm they'll give you their email
- **Test engagement** — See if they complete your content
- **Validate demand** — Check if they'll actually pay
- **Optimize systematically** — Refine based on data, not guesses

## How to Use This Framework

Start with Stage 1 (Identity) and work sequentially. Each stage unlocks after
you complete the previous one's success criteria.

Don't skip stages. The framework compounds—later stages depend on foundations
built earlier.
