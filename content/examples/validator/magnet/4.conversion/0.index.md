Attention without conversion is vanity metrics.

This stage refines your positioning, offer, and messaging to convert visitors
into email subscribers. You're proving people care enough to give you their
email—a clear demand signal.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this stage, you'll have:

- **Problem-solution clarity** — Your unique positioning
- **Process framework** — How you solve the problem
- **Irresistible offer** — What they get for their email
- **Objections addressed** — FAQ removing barriers
- **Optimized messaging** — Copy refined for clarity

## Success Criteria

- 5-15% email capture rate sustained
- Clear value proposition
- Critical objections integrated inline
- Weekly optimization cycle established

## Why This Matters

Conversion rate reveals:

- **<5%** = Positioning unclear, offer weak
- **5-15%** = Good signal, continue optimizing
- **>15%** = Strong product-message fit, ready to scale

This is where most founders fail—they build before proving conversion.

## Time Investment

**Total: 1-2 weeks of iterative optimization**

This is data-driven refinement. Measure, adjust, repeat.
