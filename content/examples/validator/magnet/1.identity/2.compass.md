# Your Compass: Define Success on Your Terms

## Why This Matters

Without your own definition of success, you'll chase someone else's.

Most founders optimize for the wrong things: vanity metrics, comparison to
peers, arbitrary milestones that don't actually matter to them.

Your compass points you toward what success actually means for you—not your
parents, not Twitter, not other founders.

This becomes your filter for every opportunity.

## Define Enough

What is your "enough" number?

This is the income or net worth that enables your ideal life. Not infinite
growth. Not "as much as possible." A real number based on how you actually want
to live.

**Key questions:**

- How much monthly income do you need to live your ideal life?
- What does that money enable? (Lifestyle, freedom, security, impact)
- What happens after you hit that number? (Keep building, shift focus, step
  back)
- Why this number and not more or less?

This isn't about limiting ambition—it's about knowing when you've won your game,
not someone else's.

## North Star Lifestyle

What does your ideal day look like?

Not "someday when you're successful"—the actual day-to-day life you're building
toward.

**Key questions:**

- Where are you living?
- What does your daily routine look like?
- Who are you spending time with?
- What work energizes you vs. drains you?
- What are you saying NO to that you currently say yes to?
- What does freedom actually mean for you?

Be specific. Vague visions lead to vague decisions.

## Impact Orientation

Who do you want to help, and why?

This isn't about saving the world. It's about who you're uniquely positioned to
serve based on your lived experience.

**Key questions:**

- Who do you naturally want to help?
- What problem keeps you up at night?
- Who is your past self (the person 6-24 months behind you)?
- What change do you want to create in their life?

Your impact orientation comes from empathy for past-you. You're solving problems
you've already lived through.

## What You'll Do

**Define your enough number:**

Write down the specific income or net worth that enables your ideal life.
Justify why this number—what does it enable?

**Describe your north star lifestyle:**

Write 2-3 paragraphs describing your ideal day-to-day. Be specific about
location, routine, work, relationships, boundaries.

**Clarify your impact:**

Who are you building for? Why them? What transformation do you want to create?

## Success Criteria

✅ **Enough number defined** (specific, justified)  
✅ **North star lifestyle described** (specific, visualizable)  
✅ **Impact orientation clarified** (who you help and why)

## Ideas

- Chasing Unicorns needs to be mentioned
- You don't have to stop at 'Enough', but this is your foundation for happiness
  longterm
- Create AI prompt for this
- Add my own personal example
- Metrics need work
- Not enough focus on the programming people receive, then need to understand
  that many of the things they think they want, are because they have been told
  they should
