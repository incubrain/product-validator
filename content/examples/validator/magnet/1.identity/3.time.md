## Required Context

- Probably need to do the Foundation / Values Document before this so they can
  incorporate this into their decisions making frameworks
- You = Product = Brain = Asset - this section needs to be done before this;
  since they know that they are an asset and the product - more time means they
  can improve themselves (their product)

You don't want money, money is just a proxy to time; freedom, experiences,
travel, love, fine dining etc. is just how you choose to spend this time.

You want autonomy over your time, how you spend that is extremely personal and
outside the scope of this course. But I'm certain that if you can buy your time,
you can use it to earn enough to fill it with whatever you want!

**Let's buy some time**

Time is both mental and physical, the easiest time to aquire is mental as it's
free, so we'll start there. Remember, your first thought should be "Can I delete
this?", removing things is ALWAYS better.

## Mental Time

(First they will need to do an audit on how they spend their time)

- Close your open loops; these things live in your head and take up space for no
  reason.
- Remove clutter from your home, your car, your office; the places you spend
  most time
- Create systems to ensure clutter doesn't happen again
- Remove small decisions, especially in the morning
- Remove options for small decisions; 3 options is much easier than 10 for quick
  decisions
- Use Decision Frameworks for medium level decisions
- Get good at saying NO to things that take up time and you don't want to do
- Improve the quality of your time with exercise, diet, and better sleep
- Optimise high value rooms like Bedroom, Home Office, Kitchen
- Block Time
- Caffiene Restrition
- Limit Alcohol

## Physical Time

- Buy back your time
- Outsource Work
- Cut back on work hours if possible
- Limit screen time
- Block time for relationships
- Reduce Expenses
