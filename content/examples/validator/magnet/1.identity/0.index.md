Before you build anything, you need to know who you are and what you stand for.

This stage isn't fluff—it's strategic. Your identity becomes your competitive
advantage. Your values guide your decisions. Your edge defines what you build.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this stage, you'll have:

- **Core values defined** — Your non-negotiable principles
- **Success compass** — Your personal definition of "enough"
- **Founder edge** — Your unique problem-solution fit
- **Network built** — 100 people who share your values
- **Voice established** — Your distinct communication style
- **Execution system** — Daily habits that compound

## Why This Comes First

Founders who skip identity work:

- Build misaligned products that drain them
- Sound like everyone else (no differentiation)
- Make decisions based on comparison, not conviction
- Burn out when growth slows

Your identity is your moat. Everything else builds on this foundation.

## Time Investment

**Total: 8-10 hours spread over 1-2 weeks**

This isn't a weekend exercise—it's foundational work that will guide everything
you build.
