# Daily Execution System: Show Up & Ship

## Why This Matters

Identity without execution is fantasy.

You need systems to:

- Show up consistently (even when you don't feel like it)
- Move the needle daily (small actions compound)
- Ship fast and refine iteratively (speed beats perfection)

This isn't about productivity hacks. It's about sustainable momentum.

## Show Up Daily

Consistency beats intensity.

Small daily actions compound into massive results over months. Missing days
kills momentum.

**Your daily non-negotiables:**

What are the 1-3 actions you commit to daily, no matter what?

**Examples:**

- Engage with 10 posts from your 100 List
- Write/publish one piece of content
- Work on product for 2 focused hours
- Move the needle on highest-value task

Pick what matters most for your current stage. Don't overcommit—pick what you
can sustain.

## Move The Needle

What's the ONE thing you can do today that would make today a success?

Every morning, identify your highest-value task. The thing that, if completed,
means you moved closer to your compass (Step 2).

**Key questions:**

- What task has the biggest impact?
- What am I avoiding because it's hard?
- What moves me toward my enough number?
- What creates the most value for others?

Do this task first, while your energy is highest.

Everything else is secondary.

## Ship Fast, Refine Iteratively

**Best part is no part.**

Your first version will be complex. That's okay.

Your job isn't to start with a simple idea—it's to iteratively simplify after
shipping.

**The simplification process:**

1. **Ship something** (get it working, get it in front of people)
2. **Remove, don't add** (what can you cut? Where's the friction?)
3. **Apply confidence threshold:**
   - Certain it can be removed? → Remove it
   - 75% sure? → Figure out how to remove it
   - 50/50? → Try to merge it with something else
   - Leaning toward keeping it? → Forget about it for now

**Two angles for removal:**

**Customer friction:**

- What makes the product harder to use?
- What slows them down?
- What confuses them?
- Remove it → product becomes more valuable

**Founder friction:**

- What makes delivery harder for you?
- What takes unnecessary time?
- What prevents scaling?
- Remove it → you have more time or can serve more customers

Simplification is iterative. Don't expect day-one simplicity. Expect relentless
refinement.

**Never optimize or add before you simplify.**

## What You'll Do

**Define your daily non-negotiables:**

Pick 1-3 actions you commit to daily. Make them sustainable, not heroic.

**Establish your "move the needle" practice:**

Every morning, identify the one highest-value task. Do it first.

**Adopt the simplification mindset:**

Ship something working. Then remove, don't add.

Use the confidence threshold for every element:

- Certain → remove
- 75% sure → figure out how to remove
- 50/50 → ignore for now
- Leaning toward keep → simplify or merge

Ask constantly: Customer friction or founder friction? Remove it.

## Success Criteria

✅ **Daily non-negotiables defined** (1-3 actions)  
✅ **Move the needle practice established** (identify highest-value task
daily)  
✅ **Simplification mindset adopted** (remove before adding, confidence
threshold applied)  
✅ **First week executed** (daily actions completed consistently)

---

**Time investment:** 60 minutes to define, then daily execution  
**Key insight:** Consistency compounds, simplification scales  
**Core principle:** Ship fast, refine ruthlessly
