# Core Values & Self-Knowledge: Know Who You Are

## Why This Matters

Everything flows from who you are.

Without clarity on your core identity, you'll chase someone else's definition of
success, build products that drain you, and sound like everyone else.

Your values become your differentiation. Your beliefs become your positioning.

This is introspection—understanding where you are right now and what makes you
unique.

## Core Values

Your values aren't aspirational—they're what you already live by, consciously or
not.

These drive every decision: what you build, who you work with, what
opportunities you take, who you choose to spend time with.

**Key questions:**

- What makes you angry when violated?
- What do you refuse to compromise on?
- When have you walked away from money or opportunity? Why?
- What principles guide you when making hard decisions?

Your core values include your non-negotiables—the boundaries you won't cross
even under pressure. These aren't separate from your values; they're the
strongest expression of them.

**Example values:**

- Autonomy / Freedom
- Truth / Honesty over comfort
- Growth / Learning
- Impact / Contribution
- Health / Energy
- Financial security
- Deep work / Focus

Pick 3-5 that are genuinely yours. Not what sounds good. What you actually live
by.

## Contrarian Beliefs

What do you believe that most people don't?

This is where differentiation begins. Your unique worldview creates your unique
positioning.

**Key questions:**

- What does everyone get wrong about your domain?
- What "best practice" do you ignore?
- What uncomfortable truth do you know from experience?
- What would you argue with most people about?

These beliefs come from lived experience, not theory. They're often unpopular
because they challenge conventional wisdom.

**Examples:**

- "Most people believe you need customer research before building. I believe you
  should build for your past self first because your lived experience is more
  valuable than surveys."
- "Most people believe you should wait until it's perfect. I believe shipping a
  placeholder and iterating with real users beats planning forever."
- "Most people believe content quality matters most. I believe consistency and
  volume matter more in the first year."

Your contrarian beliefs will inform your messaging, product decisions, and who
you attract.

## What You'll Do

**Identify your core values:**

Write down what you genuinely stand for. What drives your decisions? What
boundaries do you protect?

Focus on what you already live by, not what you wish you valued.

**Define your contrarian beliefs:**

What do you believe that most people in your space don't? Base these on lived
experience, not theory.

These become the foundation of your unique positioning.

**Test your authenticity:**

- Would past-you (6-24 months ago) recognize these values?
- Can you point to decisions where you lived these?
- Are you willing to lose opportunities that conflict with these?

✅ **3-5 contrarian beliefs defined** (based on lived experience)

## Ideas

- Add my core values
- Create AI prompt for helping to identify this, injest some frameworks and
  books / articles on this topic (deep research required)
- This article needs to focus more on why this is important, not the
  methodologies of how we do it, that should be for AI
