# Hook Crafting: Your Hero Section Message

## Why This Matters

Your hero section is the first thing visitors see. You have 5 seconds to answer:
"Is this for me?"

Get it wrong → 70%+ bounce rate (they leave immediately).  
Get it right → They scroll, read your offer, potentially sign up.

This isn't just your landing page. Your hero hook becomes:

- Your H1 tag (SEO)
- Your tweet bio
- Your one-liner when people ask "what do you do?"
- The foundation for all future copy

**Nail this now, refine based on bounce rate data later.**

## What Is The Hero Section?

The hero section is the top part of your landing page, visible without
scrolling.

It contains two key elements:

**H1 (Main Headline):**

- Large, bold text
- Problem OR promise
- Must resonate in 3 seconds

**Subtitle (Supporting Text):**

- Explains what/how/why
- Provides context and transformation
- 10-15 words max

**Example from this template:**

- **H1:** "Sick of Being 'Almost Ready' to Launch?"
- **Subtitle:** "Flip the script and ship a headless funnel today, let data
  drive your business decisions."

## The Pain-First Hook Formula

Successful hooks follow a 2-part structure:

```
[H1: Problem or Promise] + [Subtitle: Context & Transformation]
```

**H1 Options:**

**Option A — Pain-focused:**

- Format: "Stuck in [frustration]?"
- Example: "Drowning in admin work?"
- When to use: When pain is immediately recognizable

**Option B — Promise-focused:**

- Format: "[Outcome] without [pain]"
- Example: "Validate with data, not guesses"
- When to use: When transformation is more compelling than pain

**Subtitle rules:**

- Explain the outcome in plain language
- Format: "[Action] and [benefit], [transformation result]"
- Avoid buzzwords — talk like a human
- 10-15 words maximum

**Pattern source:** This structure appears consistently across successful indie
founder launches—Pieter Levels (Nomad List), Sahil Lavingia (Gumroad), Justin
Jackson (Transistor.fm).

**Examples:**

- Pain: "Perfectionism killing your launches?"
- Promise: "Validate in weeks, not months"
- Pain: "Drowning in lesson reports?"
- Promise: "Automate your admin, reclaim 10 hours"

**5-second test:** Would past-you (from Step 2) stop scrolling? If not, try
again.

### Step 2: Write Your Subtitle (15 min)

Your subtitle adds context and explains the transformation.

**Format:**

```
[Action] and [benefit], [transformation result].
```

**Examples:**

- H1: "Perfectionism killing your launches?"
  - Subtitle: "Ship a metrics-driven funnel today, let data guide your
    decisions, not fear."

- H1: "Drowning in lesson reports?"
  - Subtitle: "Automate your templates and reclaim 10 hours per week for actual
    teaching."

- H1: "Validate with data, not guesses"
  - Subtitle: "Deploy a live validation page in under an hour, iterate based on
    real user behavior."

**Rules:**

- Use plain language (no jargon or buzzwords)
- Be specific about the outcome (time saved, pain removed, result gained)
- Keep it under 15 words
- Read it out loud — does it sound natural?

### Step 3: Test 3 Variations (30 min)

Create 3 complete hero sections (H1 + subtitle each).

**Variation 1: Pain → Transformation**

- H1: Pain-focused question
- Subtitle: How you solve it + transformation

**Variation 2: Promise → Context**

- H1: Promise-focused statement
- Subtitle: What it is + who it's for

**Variation 3: Question → Answer**

- H1: Question format
- Subtitle: Direct answer with benefit

**Example set for a productivity tool:**

**Variation 1:**

- H1: "Wasting hours on repetitive admin?"
- Subtitle: "Automate your workflows and reclaim 15 hours per week for deep
  work."

**Variation 2:**

- H1: "Productivity without the busywork"
- Subtitle: "A simple automation tool that handles your repetitive tasks while
  you focus on what matters."

**Variation 3:**

- H1: "What if admin took 5 minutes instead of 5 hours?"
- Subtitle: "Set up your automations once, save time every single day."

**Pick your favorite** based on:

- Which resonates most with your past self?
- Which is most specific?
- Which feels most authentic (not salesy)?

## Hero Section Examples

**Example 1 — Pain → Promise (FeedbackPanda style):**

- H1: "Drowning in student reports?"
- Subtitle: "Automate your feedback templates and reclaim your evenings for
  life, not admin."

**Example 2 — Promise → Context (Nomad List style):**

- H1: "Find your next remote work destination"
- Subtitle: "Real data on 500+ cities: cost of living, internet speed, safety,
  and community."

**Example 3 — Question → Answer (This template):**

- H1: "Sick of being 'almost ready' to launch?"
- Subtitle: "Ship a validation funnel today, let data drive your business
  decisions, not fear."

**Key insight from Daniel Vassallo's Twitter success:** Authenticity beats
polish. Your raw, honest hook will resonate more than a perfectly crafted
corporate message. Ship the version that sounds like you talking to a friend.

## Success Criteria

✅ **3 hero section variations written** (H1 + subtitle each)  
✅ **Based on YOUR lived experience**
✅ **Clear problem or promise in H1**  
✅ **Specific transformation in subtitle**  
✅ **Add to live site**

**How to choose which to deploy:**

1. Which one would past-you click on?
2. Which is most specific (not generic)?
3. Which sounds most like how you actually talk?

**Remember:** You can (and should) iterate based on bounce rate data. But you
need traffic first. Ship this version now, refine with data later.

**Time investment:** 1 hour  
**Key insight:** Your H1 determines if visitors stay or bounce in 5 seconds  
**Next step:** Drive traffic to test your hook with real users
