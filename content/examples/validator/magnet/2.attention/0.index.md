You can't validate demand without attention.

This stage proves people care about your problem before you build the solution. If you can't get 10-30 daily visitors organically, paid ads won't save you.

## What You'll Validate

By the end of this stage, you'll know:

- **Can you articulate the problem compellingly?** (Hook crafting)
- **Can you drive traffic without paid ads?** (Guerrilla marketing)
- **Do people stay or bounce?** (Bounce rate < 70%)

## Success Criteria

- 10-30 daily visitors sustained for 1-2 weeks
- Bounce rate < 70%
- Traffic from 2-3 reliable organic sources

## Why This Matters

If you can't get free attention, you don't have:
- A compelling hook
- A real problem worth solving
- Product-market fit potential

Attention is the first signal. Everything else builds on this.

## Time Investment

**Total: 2-4 weeks, 4+ hours/day on traffic generation**

This is the grind stage. Attention doesn't happen overnight—it compounds daily.
