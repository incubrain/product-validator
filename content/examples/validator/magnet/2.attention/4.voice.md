# Founder Voice Foundation: Speak Your Truth

## Why This Matters

Buyers don't trust neutral voices. They trust conviction.

Your voice emerges from your values (Step 1), your beliefs (Step 1), and your
edge (Step 3).

Developing a truly unique voice takes years. But you need a foundation to
start—something authentic that you can refine as you go.

This step gives you that foundation.

## Learn From Your Network

Your 100 List (Step 4) is your voice laboratory.

**Study what works:**

- Which posts go viral from people you admire?
- What tone do they use?
- How do they structure their arguments?
- What beliefs do they express?
- How do they challenge conventional wisdom?

Copy 10-20 viral posts from your network into a document. Analyze patterns:

- Opening hooks
- Structure (story, data, question, statement)
- Tone (warm, sharp, provocative, mentor-like)
- Length and formatting

Use AI to analyze these patterns and suggest a voice foundation based on:

- Your core values (Step 1)
- Your contrarian beliefs (Step 1)
- Your founder edge (Step 3)
- Patterns from successful posts in your network

This isn't copying—it's learning the language of your space, then adapting it to
your unique perspective.

## Define Your Message Pillars

What do you stand for and against?

**3 Belief Pillars** (what you advocate):

Based on your contrarian beliefs from Step 1, what will you consistently talk
about?

**Example:**

1. Validate before building: Most founders waste months on features nobody wants
2. You are the product: Your lived experience is your competitive advantage
3. Ship signal, not perfection: Done and iterating beats planning forever

**3 Myths You Destroy** (what you fight against):

What common beliefs do you challenge?

**Example:**

1. "Do customer research first": Wrong—start with your own pain
2. "Wait until it's perfect": Wrong—ship placeholder, iterate with data
3. "You need a big audience first": Wrong—start with 10-30 daily visitors

These pillars become your content themes. Everything you publish references back
to these.

## Your Founder Manifesto

Write your "This is who I am" statement.

This is 200-300 words that synthesize:

- Your contrarian beliefs
- Your founder edge
- Who you're building for
- Who this is NOT for

**Structure:**

```
I believe [contrarian truth].

Most people [common approach].
I [your different approach] because [lived experience].

I built [product/offer] for [who] who [pain].

This is for you if [specific criteria].
This is NOT for you if [specific criteria].

I stand for [value].
I fight against [myth].
```

This becomes your about page, your intro, your positioning statement.

## What You'll Do

**Study your network:**

Copy 10-20 viral posts from your 100 List. Analyze patterns in tone, structure,
hooks, and messaging.

Use AI to identify patterns and suggest voice foundations aligned with your
values and beliefs.

**Define your message pillars:**

Write 3 belief pillars (what you advocate) based on your contrarian beliefs.

Write 3 myths you destroy (what you fight against) based on what frustrates you
about conventional wisdom.

**Write your manifesto:**

Synthesize your beliefs, edge, and positioning into 200-300 words.

Test: Does this sound like you? Would past-you trust this person?

## Ideas

- Consider moving to attention stage, seem more appropriate there, right before
  the 'traffic' step
- Curiosity is king, we should aim to make people curious to know more about
  what we are doing, then they will follow us, look into our products etc etc.
