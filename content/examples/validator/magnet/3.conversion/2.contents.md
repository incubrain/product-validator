# Features & Process: Structure Your Solution

## Why This Matters

You've defined the problem and your unique positioning (Step 1). Now visitors need to understand: **How do you actually solve this?**

Without a clear process, your solution feels abstract. With a structured framework, it becomes tangible and actionable.

This step fills in your **Process section** with a step-by-step breakdown of your solution.

## The Process Framework

**What is "Process" in your landing page?**

It's the section that shows your methodology—the steps someone takes to achieve the transformation you promise.

**Why it matters for conversion:**
- Makes your solution feel concrete (not vague promises)
- Shows you have a systematic approach (credibility)
- Helps them visualize using your product
- Reduces uncertainty about what they're signing up for

**Example from this template:**

Our process = 5-stage validation framework:
1. Attention (drive traffic)
2. Conversion (capture emails)
3. Engagement (deliver value)
4. Demand (test willingness to pay)
5. Build Prep (optimize full funnel)

Each stage has a clear outcome and success metric.

## Features vs. Process

**Features** = What your product includes  
**Process** = How someone uses it to achieve outcome

**Bad (feature list):**
- Email templates
- Analytics dashboard
- Drag-and-drop builder

**Good (process):**
1. Deploy your page in 10 minutes
2. Drive traffic using our guerrilla marketing playbook
3. Measure conversion rates at each stage
4. Iterate based on data, not guesses

**Transform features into process:**
- Feature: "Email templates" → Process step: "Craft your first hook using proven formulas"
- Feature: "Analytics" → Process step: "Track daily visitors and bounce rate to validate attention"
- Feature: "Templates" → Process step: "Deploy in under 10 minutes using our template"

## What You'll Do

### Step 1: Break Down Your Solution (45 min)

Take the solution you defined in Step 1 and break it into stages.

**How many stages?**
- **3 stages minimum** (beginning, middle, end)
- **5 stages ideal** (specific enough without overwhelming)
- **7+ stages** = probably too detailed for landing page

**Each stage should have:**
1. Clear name (what phase is this?)
2. Specific outcome (what do they achieve?)
3. Time estimate (how long does this take?)
4. Success metric (how do they know it worked?)

**Example breakdown for a productivity tool:**

**Stage 1: Setup**
- Outcome: Automations configured
- Time: 15 minutes
- Metric: First automation running

**Stage 2: Integration**
- Outcome: Connected to your tools
- Time: 30 minutes
- Metric: Data flowing from 2+ sources

**Stage 3: Optimization**
- Outcome: Workflows refined
- Time: 1 week of usage
- Metric: 5+ hours saved weekly

**Your turn:**

Write down your stages:
```
Stage 1: [Name]
- Outcome: [What they achieve]
- Time: [Realistic estimate]
- Metric: [How they know it worked]

Stage 2: [Name]
...
```

### Step 2: Define Outcomes Per Stage (30 min)

For each stage, write the specific outcome someone achieves.

**Be concrete, not vague:**
- ❌ Vague: "You'll be more productive"
- ✅ Concrete: "You'll save 10 hours per week on admin tasks"

**Include the transformation:**
- From [current state] → To [desired state]
- Example: "From manually tracking time → To auto-filled timesheets"

**Make it measurable:**
- Can they tell if they've achieved it?
- Example: "10-30 daily visitors" (measurable) vs. "good traffic" (vague)

**For each stage, write:**
```
At the end of Stage [X], you will have [specific outcome] which means [transformation].

Example:
"At the end of Stage 1, you will have 10-30 daily visitors which means 
you've validated that people care enough to click."
```

### Step 3: Add Time Estimates (15 min)

Be honest about time investment per stage.

**Why honesty matters:**
- Builds trust (you're not promising magic)
- Sets realistic expectations
- Filters out people who can't commit (that's good)

**How to estimate:**
- Based on your own experience solving this
- Add 25% buffer (others will be slower than you)
- Break into focused work time (not "whenever you have a minute")

**Format:**
- Short tasks: "15 minutes", "1 hour"
- Medium tasks: "2-3 hours", "Half day"
- Ongoing: "1-2 weeks", "15 min/day for 2 weeks"

**Example:**
- Stage 1: <10 minutes (one-time setup)
- Stage 2: 1-2 hours (content creation)
- Stage 3: 15 min/day for 1-2 weeks (ongoing effort)

### Step 4: Define Success Metrics (30 min)

Each stage needs a clear "you've succeeded" signal.

**Why metrics matter:**
- Removes ambiguity ("am I done yet?")
- Builds confidence (they see progress)
- Creates momentum (small wins compound)

**Types of metrics:**

**Binary (yes/no):**
- "Site deployed and live"
- "First automation running"
- "Email sent to list"

**Quantitative (numbers):**
- "10-30 daily visitors"
- "5-15% conversion rate"
- "10 hours saved per week"

**Qualitative (observable):**
- "Comments saying 'I have this problem too'"
- "DMs asking about your product"
- "Reduced feeling of overwhelm"

**For each stage:**
```
Success metric: [Specific, measurable signal]

Example:
"Success metric: 10-30 daily visitors sustained for 1-2 weeks"
```

## Process Section Content

Now write the content that fills your **Process section**:

**Section Header:**
```
How [Product Name] Works
```

**For each stage, write:**

```
Stage [Number]: [Name]

[2-3 sentences explaining what happens in this stage]

Outcome: [Specific result they achieve]
Time: [Realistic estimate]
Success: [Clear metric]

Example:

Stage 1: Attention

Deploy your validation page with placeholder content and start driving 
traffic using guerrilla marketing tactics. Your goal is to validate that 
people care enough to click and stay (low bounce rate).

Outcome: 10-30 daily visitors with <70% bounce rate
Time: 1-2 weeks, 4+ hours/day on traffic generation
Success: Consistent traffic from 2-3 reliable sources
```

**Keep it scannable:**
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- Bold key outcomes
- Use consistent formatting per stage

## Success Criteria

✅ **Solution broken into 3-5 clear stages**  
✅ **Each stage has specific outcome defined**  
✅ **Honest time estimates per stage**  
✅ **Success metrics defined** (how they know it worked)  
✅ **Process section content written**  

**Quality checklist:**
- Would past-you understand how to use this from reading the process?
- Are outcomes concrete enough to visualize?
- Are time estimates realistic (not overly optimistic)?
- Can someone tell if they've succeeded at each stage?

## What's Next

With your process defined, you're ready to package your offer (Step 3).

You now have:
1. Clear step-by-step framework
2. Specific outcomes per stage
3. Realistic time commitments
4. Measurable success criteria
5. Content for Process section

This structure becomes the backbone of your offer—showing exactly what someone gets when they sign up.
