# Setup & Launch

## Overview

Get your validation template live in under an hour. No more "not ready yet"
excuses.

## What You'll Do

1. Clone the template repository
2. Deploy to Railway or Vercel
3. Visit your live placeholder site
4. Join the support community

## Why This Matters

Perfectionism kills more products than bad ideas. By deploying a placeholder,
you're forcing yourself into public iteration mode.

## Action

Deploy now. Placeholder content is fine. Something beats nothing.
