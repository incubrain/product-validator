# FEATURES GRID - Highlight Your Key Capabilities
# ============================================================================
# 
# PURPOSE: Showcase the main features/benefits that differentiate your product
# 
# GUIDELINES:
# - 4-8 features recommended (more = diluted impact)
# - Focus on OUTCOMES, not technical specs
# - Each feature = 1 core benefit
# - Title: 2-5 words
# - Description: 1-2 sentences explaining the value
# 
# STRUCTURE:
# - Title: The capability name
# - Description: What value it provides (focus on "why it matters")
# - Icon: Visual representation (use Lucide icons)
# 
# GOOD FEATURE EXAMPLES:
# ✅ Title: "No Vendor Lock-in"
#    Description: "Own your data. Swap providers anytime."
# ✅ Title: "Built-in Analytics"
#    Description: "Track conversions without third-party scripts."
# 
# BAD FEATURE EXAMPLES:
# ❌ Title: "Advanced Configuration System"
#    Description: "Uses YAML files with schema validation."
#    (Too technical, doesn't explain value)

# ============================================================================
# REPLACEMENT GUIDE
# ============================================================================
# 
# STEP 1: LIST YOUR UNIQUE CAPABILITIES
# Ask yourself:
# - What can users do with this that they can't do elsewhere?
# - What problems does this solve that alternatives don't?
# - What makes this faster/cheaper/better?
# 
# STEP 2: PRIORITIZE BY IMPACT
# Rank features by:
# 1. Most valuable to target user
# 2. Strongest differentiator
# 3. Easiest to understand
# 
# Keep top 4-8 features. Cut the rest.
# 
# STEP 3: WRITE USER-FOCUSED DESCRIPTIONS
# Bad: "Uses Nuxt Content for data management"
# Good: "No database required. Edit content like documents."
# 
# Formula: [Benefit] + [How it helps]
# Example: "Provider agnostic. Swap tools without rebuilding."
# 
# STEP 4: CHOOSE MEANINGFUL ICONS
# Match icon to the core benefit:
# 
# Speed/Performance:
# - i-lucide-zap
# - i-lucide-rocket
# - i-lucide-gauge
# 
# Security/Trust:
# - i-lucide-shield-check
# - i-lucide-lock
# - i-lucide-verified
# 
# Flexibility/Control:
# - i-lucide-sliders-horizontal
# - i-lucide-settings-2
# - i-lucide-puzzle
# 
# Simplicity/Ease:
# - i-lucide-smile
# - i-lucide-circle-check
# - i-lucide-sparkles
# 
# Analytics/Data:
# - i-lucide-bar-chart-3
# - i-lucide-line-chart
# - i-lucide-trending-up
# 
# Content/Writing:
# - i-lucide-file-text
# - i-lucide-pen-tool
# - i-lucide-book-open
# 
# STEP 5: TEST CLARITY
# Show the grid to someone unfamiliar with your product.
# Can they understand what each feature does in 5 seconds?
# If not, simplify the description.
#

# 
# CONTENT STRATEGY TIPS
# ============================================================================
# 
# 1. BALANCE TECHNICAL VS. BENEFIT
#    Don't say: "Built with Nuxt 4 and TypeScript"
#    Do say: "Modern tech stack. Fast, type-safe development."
# 
# 2. USE CONCRETE LANGUAGE
#    Don't say: "Flexible configuration options"
#    Do say: "Change branding, theme, and content from one file"
# 
# 3. QUANTIFY WHERE POSSIBLE
#    Don't say: "Fast deployment"
#    Do say: "Deploy in under 10 minutes"
# 
# 4. ADDRESS OBJECTIONS
#    If users worry about vendor lock-in → feature: "No vendor lock-in"
#    If users fear complexity → feature: "No coding required"
# 
# 5. MIRROR USER LANGUAGE
#    Use words your target audience uses:
#    - Developers: "Type-safe", "Hot reload", "Zero config"
#    - Non-technical: "No coding", "Drag and drop", "One-click"
#
