# PROCESS SECTION - Maximum 3 Steps
# ============================================================================
# 
# PURPOSE: Show users the HIGH-LEVEL steps to get value from your product
# 
# RULES:
# - Maximum 3 steps (enforced by component)
# - Each step = ONE clear action
# - Title: 2-4 words max
# - Result: Single sentence describing outcome
# - No technical jargon
# 
# EXAMPLES OF GOOD STEPS:
# ✅ "Clone & Install" → "Local dev environment ready"
# ✅ "Configure Content" → "Personalized landing page"
# ✅ "Deploy" → "Live URL in minutes"
# 
# EXAMPLES OF BAD STEPS:
# ❌ "Setup your development environment and configure all dependencies"
# ❌ "Implement advanced features and customizations"
# ❌ Too many sub-steps or technical details
# 
# TIPS:
# - Think: What are the 3 BIG milestones?
# - Each step should feel like an achievement
# - Results should be tangible, not abstract
# - Use simple, action-oriented language
#

# REPLACEMENT GUIDE
# ============================================================================
# 
# 1. IDENTIFY YOUR 3 CORE STEPS:
#    Ask: "What are the 3 things someone MUST do to get value?"
#    Example for a SaaS: Signup → Configure → First Result
# 
# 2. WRITE CLEAR TITLES:
#    - Use verbs: "Create", "Setup", "Launch", "Deploy"
#    - Keep it 2-4 words: "Setup Account", "Add Content", "Go Live"
# 
# 3. WRITE OUTCOME-FOCUSED RESULTS:
#    Format: "[Specific outcome] achieved"
#    Examples:
#    - "Account activated and verified"
#    - "First project created"
#    - "Live site deployed"
# 
# 4. CHOOSE APPROPRIATE ICONS:
#    Common options:
#    - i-lucide-download (install/clone)
#    - i-lucide-settings (configure)
#    - i-lucide-rocket (launch/deploy)
#    - i-lucide-check-circle (complete)
#    - i-lucide-zap (quick action)
#    - i-lucide-play-circle (start)
# 
# 5. TEST YOUR STEPS:
#    Read them out loud. Can someone understand what to do in 10 seconds?
#    If not, simplify further.
