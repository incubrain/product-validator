# Your Dream 100 List

## Why This Matters

You can't build in isolation.

Your network becomes your leverage: amplification, learning, opportunities, and
validation.

But not just any network—people who share your core values, are slightly ahead
of you, and operate in spaces you want to be in.

Every person on this list should be someone you could imagine as a close friend,
someone you care about and want the best for. This is about making friends, not
extracting value.

## The 100 List

Create a list of 100 people who:

- Share your core values (from Step 1)
- Are building in your space or adjacent spaces
- Post content that resonates with you
- Have engaged audiences (not just follower counts)

**Focus on ONE platform** (the one you use most):

- Twitter/X
- LinkedIn
- Instagram
- YouTube

Don't spread thin. Master one platform first.

## The Distribution Formula

**40% → 500-5,000 followers**

- More accessible
- More likely to engage back
- Building their audience (mutual benefit)

**40% → 5,000-50,000 followers**

- Established but not unreachable
- Proven track record
- Active engagement with audience

**20% → 50,000+ followers**

- Aspirational tier
- Learn from their content
- Occasional engagement opportunities

This distribution maximizes your chances of building real relationships while
learning from those ahead of you.

## Your Objective

**Become their friends.**

You share core values. You're interested in similar problems. This should feel
natural, not forced.

Your goal:

- Learn from their content
- Engage authentically with their posts
- Be seen in their network
- Build your reputation through association
- Eventually create your own unique voice

This isn't networking for networking's sake. It's surrounding yourself with
people who reinforce your identity and accelerate your learning.

## Success Criteria

✅ **Primary platform selected**  
✅ **100 people identified** (40/40/20 distribution)  
✅ **Tracking system created** (names, handles, why they're on list)

## Notes

- Circle of influence
- Stop thinking of it as 'Marketing' & 'Sales', instead these are just friends
  that you want to help and support along their journey, be authentic, speak
  your mind, help them and they will almost certainly help you back
- Reduce to 50 people to start
