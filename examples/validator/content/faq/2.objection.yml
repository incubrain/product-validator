  - label: I don't have an audience. How can I validate without traffic?
    content:
      Most founders start with zero audience—that's why Stage 2 focuses entirely
      on guerrilla marketing. Baseline goal - 10 visitors/day through free
      channels (Reddit communities, niche forums, direct outreach, Twitter/X
      engagement, cold email). Magnet includes distribution playbook - community
      submission tactics, outreach templates, where to find your early adopters.
      Validation forces you to learn one marketing channel deeply. If you can't
      drive 10 visitors/day, you can't build a business—better to learn that in
      Week 1 than Month 6.

  - label: I've tried validation before and got no traction. Why will this work?
    content:
      Common failure - validating hypothetical interest ('Would you use this?')
      instead of real commitment (email signup, consultation booking, payment
      intent). This template forces concrete actions at each stage with
      measurable thresholds. Plus - expert feedback calls catch positioning
      issues early, staged rollout prevents overwhelm, success metrics show
      exactly where you're stuck, and the framework guides iteration until
      validation or evidence-based pivot. It's not about trying harder—it's
      about testing the right signals with clear decision criteria.
