## My Story

Younger Mac chased programmed wants: fancy watch, nice car, home ownership. PT
studio at 19, sales job door-slams, police "lifelong career" (quit 2mo before
lock-in for Thailand crypto leap). Each cage taught: external validation
hollows. $300k burned on ghost products—adding features to impress nobody,
launching DOA from exhaustion.

Suffering clarified non-negotiables: **autonomy over hours** (Thailand leap
2018, India move 2022, stimulant doctor veto 2024), **impact for broken-me**
(empathy sales lesson: Porsche guy beats aggressive closer), **ship-to-learn
over isolation perfection** (COVID lockdown void taught me eyes equal oxygen).

Enough number dropped each move: NZ $2.5k USD median felt cage → Thailand
cheaper → India **₹2.1 lakh ($2.5k USD equivalent) equals ₹1 lakh comfort + ₹1 lakh
business** (2 employees). Validator target: **$5k USD MRR** personal foundation,
**$10k USD MRR** to scale 10+ team.

Past-me screaming (2022-2023, pre-stimulant, mid-ghost product 2): "Force me to
ship broken, validate self first, give me feedback eyes before I drown in
'almost ready.'" Validator answers that scream.

Society whispers shoulds—big exits, Lambos, comparison wins. Scrolls amplify the
fog. Your vault whispers different. Which voice owns your compass? Deprogram or
drift.

Reclaimed hours from Step 3? They fund this deprogramming—marinating on what YOU
want, not what Twitter sold you. Without time, the compass rusts in whim-fog.
With it, you carve the filter that vetoes ghosts.

## Deprogram the Shoulds

Your compass isn't infinite growth—it's a values-etched filter for YOUR enough.

List 5 things you "want." Be honest—exits, freedom, impact, wealth, status,
creation. Now cross out 3 programmed by ads, peers, parents, scroll-comparison.
The 2 survivors? Core values. My leftovers: Autonomy over hours, impact for
broken-me, daily creation. Yours?

Validator landing page asks: "$10k MRR would change your life—why chase $10M you
don't need?" Enough isn't limiting ambition; it's knowing when you've won YOUR
game, not theirs. Chasing unicorns when foundation MRR buys freedom? That's
programmed suffering, not soul-driven scale.

My loops? Chased shiny—new frameworks, comparison pivots, VC theater for
validation I didn't need. Deprogramming cleared: Solve paralysis, own my hours,
build for broken-me. Your fog? Different scars, same cage.

## Etch Your North Star

Compass as veto-filter—every idea, opportunity, feature runs through: "Pulls my
snapshot? Keep. Feeds comparison fog? Kill." Binary clarity.

Ideal day, sensory-specific: My snapshot? Wake mountains, no alarm. Coffee,
vault-work till noon. Prototype suffering-solutions for paralysis like mine.
Hike. Dinner with unchained time. Sleep proud, shipped real. Specific? Yes.
Vague visions birth vague decisions, whim-pivots, hollowed hustle.

Clarity on lifestyle pulls decisions like gravity, preventing whim-suffering.
Compass isn't "$10M ARR"—it's "wake unchained, create daily, solve for
broken-me." Revenue? Means to lifestyle, never the end. Confuse them, hollow
your vault.

## Define Enough

Know your win condition. Not vanity metrics. Not infinite scale. Your enough
number—the monthly income that buys freedom to wake without alarm, choose
suffering, work on vault without cage.

Mine? $10k MRR. Justification: Covers life, funds time-buying (outsource
admin/cleaning), leaves margin for forge-deep work and broken-me impact. Yours?
Voice it, justify it against lifestyle snapshot, own the scoreboard.

Compass unclear? You'll pivot on whims, build for ghosts, leak motivation when
comparison bites. Snapshot etched? Every validator feature ranks against: "Does
this serve broken-me from 2 years ago?" Filters flow from YOUR north star, not
market theater.

## Impact for Past-You

Who's your 6-24 months-ago broken self? My paralysis loops—ADHD fog,
perfectionist traps, $300k sunk in unchosen suffering. Yours?

Solve THEIR hell with your forge. That empathy? Unshakeable motivation.
Authentic product-market fit with yourself first—you'll use it daily, crave it
like air, ship it relentlessly because it's the tool broken-you screamed for.

Impact flows from lived empathy, scaling authenticity. Build the scar-solution
past-you needed. That's your moat, your compass-pull, your enough justified.

Snapshot etched? Next: thread it daily—micro-habits that compound toward this
vision, not society's treadmill. Compass without needles? Fantasy. Needles
without compass? Whim-suffering on repeat.

[Potential cross-reference: Reclaimed hours fund this deprogramming—time fuels
compass clarity (ties to Time).]

[Tentative: Non-negotiables stem from blueprint scars + forge joys—values aren't
abstract; they're scar-proven (ties to Brain/Suffer).]

Etch your compass? Yes—needles thread true. No? Whim-suffering till broke.
Choose.

## Takeaway

Took Thailand, Philippines, India, $300k, 13 years to deprogram: unicorns I
didn't need (VC theater, feature perfection, lifelong police cage) versus
soul-survivors (autonomy, broken-me impact, daily shipping). Enough isn't high
number—it's freedom math. India: $2k USD/mo personal comfort, $5k USD MRR equals
2 employees + autonomy. Compass vetoes ghosts.
