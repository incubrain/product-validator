# Deploy Placeholder

## Why This Matters

Perfectionism kills more products than bad ideas. By deploying a placeholder,
you're forcing yourself into public iteration mode.

The goal is simple: **Get something live. Now.**

## What You'll Do

1. **One-click deploy** →
   [See README for deployment instructions](https://github.com/incubrain/founder-funnel#readme)
2. **Visit your live URL** → Confirm it loads
3. **Verify analytics** → Check that your analytics provider is receiving events

## Success Criteria

✅ Live URL accessible  
✅ Placeholder content visible  
✅ Analytics tracking confirmed  
✅ Environment variable set correctly

## What's Next

Once deployed, you'll craft your first hook (the message that captures
attention).
