title: Minimum Viable Idea (MVI)
description:
  Reframed validation philosophy from MVP to MVI — testing ideas before building
  them. Established separation between structure, content, and examples for
  scalable reuse.

## Core Insight: Validate Ideas, Not Artifacts

Traditional product thinking focuses on **building first**, validating later.  
We inverted that model.

**Shift:** From MVP (Minimum Viable Product) → **MVI (Minimum Viable Idea)**

Before investing time and energy building a deliverable, we test whether the
_idea itself_ resonates. This ensures effort is directed toward concepts that
already demonstrate traction.

### Why MVI Matters

- **Prevents waste:** Don’t build what nobody wants.
- **Refines faster:** Feedback loops start earlier.
- **Tests positioning:** Gauge audience resonance before product creation.

**Example:** A landing page can validate a workbook concept without creating
it.  
5% signup vs 20% signup tells you where to invest.

## Design Philosophy: Modular by Intent

We committed to **example-driven development** — our internal validator example
demonstrates how ideas map into structure, not implementation.

### Guiding Principles

- **Decouple structure and content:** Framework stays stable; examples evolve.
- **Teach by example:** Real configurations show usage better than docs.
- **Scalable by design:** Separation enables future expansion with minimal
  friction.

**Outcome:**  
A foundational structure that supports any use case — fitness coaches, makers,
or founders — all validating ideas through the same philosophical lens.
