Most founders validate market first—customer interviews, surveys, competitive
analysis—then fail anyway. Why? They skip the foundation: themselves.

You are the business. Your brain—scarred by experiences, wired for yes/no
decisions—is the vault everything amplifies from. Your product? Born from
suffering you've already lived. Your customer? Past-you, 6-24 months ago,
screaming for the solution you're building now.

Skip self-validation, build for ghosts. Nail it? Foundation unshakeable,
motivation unstoppable.

## Why Identity First

42% of startups fail building products nobody wants (CB Insights). Not because
markets don't exist—because founders build misaligned. They chase unicorns they
don't need, solve problems they never lived, copy competitors instead of mining
their vault.

Four hours total across five steps. Skip it? Risk six months building the wrong
thing for the wrong reasons. Nail it? Validate that you're the primary customer,
ensuring daily-use addiction, authentic resonance, relentless shipping.

This is Stage 0—self before market. Without it, every future stage builds on
fog.

## What This Isn't

This isn't customer interviews. Not market research. Not feature ideation—yet.

This is vault-mapping: the unshakeable foundation before you build anything
others touch. You're validating that YOU are the customer, that YOUR scars seed
authentic solutions, that YOUR compass filters unicorn-fog from soul-driven
scale.

External validation comes next (Attention stage). But without internal clarity,
you'll pivot on whims, ghost-chase, burn out when motivation evaporates.

## What You'll Need

Continue using the tools from the main overview:

- **LLM access** (ChatGPT, Claude, or similar) for guided prompts
- **Handy** (optional but recommended) for speech-to-text—voice unlocks raw
  vault-truth

Each step includes an LLM system prompt. Paste it, speak your scars, iterate
till artifacts emerge.

## How You'll Know It's Working

You'll know Identity is complete when:

**All 5 artifacts exist:** Blueprint sketched, forge entry journaled, time plan
projected, compass snapshot etched, needle stack tracked for 7 days.

**Compass clarity >7/10:** Gut-check—can you veto ideas confidently against your
snapshot? Does your enough number feel soul-anchored, not comparison-driven?

**Hunger for Attention:** You're ready to build audience now, before product.
Artifacts give you messaging hooks, authentic positioning, unshakeable
motivation to ship into eyes not voids.

If stuck on one step, move forward—artifacts compound, they don't block. Loop
back when clarity hits.

## Execute, Don't Consume

Voice your scars using the LLM prompts. Journal the entries. Sketch the plans.
Track the needles.

Reading about the vault doesn't map it. Shipping artifacts does.
