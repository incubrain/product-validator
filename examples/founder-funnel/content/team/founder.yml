story:
  mission: I built Founder Funnel to give technical founders a way to validate ideas without the "SaaS Tax".
  background:
    - After launching 10+ products, I realized I was spending more time fighting with drag-and-drop tools than writing code.
    - This is the stack I use for every new idea. It's free, it's yours, and it scales.
  challenge: Stop renting your funnel. Start owning it.
