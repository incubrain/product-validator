- Add a '/join' route that is concise and used for direct joining in marketing
  campaigns (~150vh on desktop), probably would be part of the demand stage

## Ideas

- Let people know the real you, you should want to be seen, some people will not
  like you and that's ok - but it is better to be known for who you are than the
  mask your wear to protect your feelings
- Stop trying to do everything yourself, to lead you must empower others, to
  succeed it's easier to help others to succeed
- Accepting mediocrity from others hurts them and you, you must have standards
  and communicate them effectively
- Capital is a proxy to enlightenment - use it to persue your passions and
  interestes, if you try to do everything today you will likely fail, pick the
  thing that will give you capital so you can do everything later in life - this
  is a lesson about self-control or disipline
- The driving forces for good products - Help people, what is help? Save them
  time, save them money, help them grow, help them learn, make them feel seen,
  tribalism,
- Take care of yourself, you are the product so you need to refine yourself -
  read books, optimize your sleep, your work environment, free up your time so
  you have more focussed time for building your business, outsource food, chores
  etc etc.
- Stop playing nice, you need to aggressively get your message out there, people
  NEED YOU, they NEED to hear what you have to say, THEY NEED your product to
  solve their problem - being nice is HARMING THEM and YOU, the 'Nice' thing to
  do is to market your product aggressively - Be an EMPATH
- Do NOT hire people until the pain of you doing the task become unbearable, and
  you have already created a system that can be handed off to achieve consistent
  results
- Listening to your critics will keep you grounded - you don't have to aggree
  them - but if you only listen to the positive feedback you will become a
  delusional megalomaniac
- Perspective, if you have a powerful enough microscope you can theroetically
  zoom in infinitely, if you have a powerful enough telescope you can look out
  infinitely - maybe space ship is better - you can zoom out from earth
  infinitely
- Growth mindset - atomic habits compount and add up to huge results, just like
  investing in the stock markets, investing in yourself, your environment, your
  circle of influence, your business; intelligently, daily will have HUGHE
  impact given a long enough time horizon.
- If you're the smartest person in the room, you're in the wrong room - surround
  yourself with people you can learn from, grow with, and share your passion for
  growth and excellence
- Saying No is one of the most powerful things you can do as an entreprenuer,
  you must learn to say NO to another feature, to customers who ask for
  something that is not aligned with your values, to your family, your friends,
  your spouse and YOURSELF!
- Clear values and NON-NEGOTIABLES are key to saying NO, a clear vision for what
  your business stands for, what is the problem you are solving, and the scope
  of that problem will help you to stay focussed. Product Validator - we are not
  solving how to build your product, we are solving how to know what to build!
- No body cares about your product - they care about themselves

- Create a product that solves a pain for yourself, something that you would
  actually use. ![Product Ideation](image-1.png) - It is much easier to market
  from a place of authority (experience), than to break into a new industry and
  start from the ground floor
- Create REAL urgency, when framing your urgency your customers need to know WHY
  it is urgent - ![Urgency Framework](image-2.png)
- Create REAL SCARCITY - Your time is limited, there's only so many hours in a
  day for you to invest in your customers, if you accept too many your product
  will be mediocre - you need to balance the time you have to give, the number
  of customers you can service at a high standard, and the price you will have
  to charge to make this profitble. Fear of Loss ties into this
- Do things that don't scale initially - you can automate later, especially with
  how quickly AI is advancing, if you can do it on a computer - it can almost
  certainly be automated in the next ~5 years if not today. n8n is a powerful
  tool here.
- Message Continuity - does your advertising/social messaging match what they
  see when they visit your website, if it does not you will see sky high bounce
  rates
- Confirmation Bias - people tend to seek out things that confirm their existing
  beliefs or attitudes
- Familiarity Bias - people tend to prefer things that are familiar to them
- Early Adopter Mentality - They are more forgiving, your product doesn't have
  to be perfect, it should work and do the thing you claim, but the UI doesn't
  have to be polished, the pipeline can be rough, it can be peiced together - it
  just has to work!
- 80/20 on content distribution, networking, outreach, commenting, responding,
  reposting vs content creation - scale to ~60/40 post product market fit. In
  the beginning you are guessing at the content you are creating, you don't know
  if it will resonate, you probably don't have an audience - so it is better to
  be a sponge and absorb from those who do, piggyback off of their audience,
  share what resonates, and create small easy to craft posts for your own
  account. Spending 4 hours writing a blog post before you have validated the
  idea with a quick social media post/thread or reel is a BAD TIME INVESTMENT.
- Move the needle every day - what is the most important thing I can get done
  today, that moves the needle the most in my personal/professional life?
- What is a funnel, what are we creating here with the lead magnet, then the low
  ticket, medium ticket, and high ticket product?
- The OODA Loop - Decision making framework for making quick decisions based on
  the data, consider incorporating.
- Your landing page is a SALES page, the goal is convert people you have already
  marketed: 🪧 Advertising = Putting up a sign that says “Circus Coming to
  Town.” 🐘 Promotion = Walking an elephant down the street with that sign. 📰
  Publicity = The elephant accidentally strolling through the mayor’s garden
  (and the press covering it). 😂 Public Relations = Getting the mayor to laugh
  about it instead of shutting the whole thing down. 💰 Sales = Convincing
  people at the ticket booth to buy a front-row seat. Credit to

- Optimizing = Reducing Friction for your customers or yourself; less customer
  friction = better product, less founder friction = scalability (more time or
  more customers)
- Feedback, be specific first, general later - ask for feedback on the problems
  you are facing today, general feedback is for identifying problems you aren't
  aware of, and problems you don't want to solve
- Develop Your Compass - Where your company is going, why you want to go there,
  what needs to happen today to get there, what it will look like when you are
  there. Do the same for your customers!
- What is your Number? how much money is enough for you to live the life you
  desire, what are nice to have vs MUST HAVE, do you really need/want that fancy
  sports car or have you just been conditioned/programmed to think you do
  because it's a status symbol - stop doing things for other people - your
  happiness is the only goal here: the most valuable things can be measured by
  the amount of consistent happiness they give you - start with buying back your
  time, now your day is free to fill with things that will make you happy - what
  would you do and how much will it cost - this is your number - this can change
  over time, but it should be considered your baseline. Once off expenses should
  also be accomodated for here.
- As an entreprenuer you are the brand, if you build marketing channels for your
  business before you build your own, you're gambling that your business will be
  successful, and if you sell that business you lose one of your most valudable
  assets - your audience / reach. Building brand social presense is only
  something you should consider doing if you have more than 1-10k customers,
  many businesses never need this.
- Pain, Profession, Passion - Your business will probably come from one of these
  three things
- Customers - People like you, people you have helped before, people who are
  underserved
- The specificity of the problem you solves increases the value and what you can
  charge for it, general < valuable < price. Specificity also reduces
  competitors
- For marketing / sales - you are either going to get something you want, or
  avoid something you don't - specificity is key here
- Environment → Eliminate friction, cut distractions ruthlessly in your personal
  life
- Ask for referrals instead of asking for sales, do you know anybody who would
  benefit from this thing. Message structure: Greet, Compliment,
  Problem/Solution, Referral.
