    <h1>Founder Story

      - Hi, I'm Mac; I created the Product Validator to break my cycle; after 13 years as a struggling founder and an ADHD diagnosis I've identified what was blocking me.
    - My obsession with business (and personal development) started when I was 16, I read all the books, and caught the first wave of YouTube 'gurus'
    - I was in love!
    - At 19 I started my first business (PT Studio), and if I'm honest - it's the closets I've been to a sustainable business out of 10+ attempts; 2 of which consumed 5 years of my life full-time, never earning a cent.
    - I've worked 15+ jobs from McDonald's Staff to Frontline Police to Crypto Bro before finding my second love; programming (Nuxt ❤️). Now I could do it all myself; nothing was going to stop me!
    - That was 6 years ago...
    - The truth is my brain created excuses not to do the things I knew I should - 'You can do better', 'People wont pay for this yet', 'I need to do this first', 'Just one more feature' the list goes on.
    - It's painful to admit, but I was addicted to building.
    - Why now, what's changed? Honestly; I'm tired of being broke when I know I have so much value to give; I'm tired of the excuses that stop me from helping others like me; and I'm tired of not allowing myself to be happy.
    - It's exhausting and I'm done!!
