## ‚ú® Why This Template Exists

Most founders get stuck in perfectionist loops:

- "Just one more feature..."
- "I need to research more first..."
- "It's not ready to show anyone yet..."

**This template forces a different path:**

1. **Deploy with placeholders** (break the "not ready" barrier)
2. **Replace with your content** (positioning, offer, value proposition)
3. **Drive traffic** (validate attention before building)
4. **Track metrics** (data-driven decisions at each stage)
5. **Build only what's validated** (stop guessing, start measuring)

**Result:** Know if people want your solution before investing months building
it.

### **Core Features**

**Metrics-Driven Framework:**

- ‚úÖ 5-stage validation journey with clear thresholds
- ‚úÖ Progressive disclosure (UI adapts to validation stage)
- ‚úÖ Data-driven decision framework
- ‚úÖ Conversion-optimized components (exit-intent, CTAs)
- ‚úÖ Provider-agnostic analytics events
- ‚úÖ Type-safe configuration system

**Developer Experience:**

- ‚úÖ Hot Module Replacement for config changes
- ‚úÖ Inline documentation in config files
- ‚úÖ Type-safe validation stage system
- ‚úÖ One-click deployment (Vercel/Railway)
- ‚úÖ Pre-configured analytics (Umami) - easily swap via
  [Nuxt Scripts](https://scripts.nuxt.com/scripts)

## üéØ 5-Stage Validation Journey

The template guides you through a metrics-driven validation process. Set your
current stage via `NUXT_PUBLIC_VALIDATION_STAGE` environment variable.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** Always start with `attention` unless you already have an
established traffic source and marketing experience. Each stage builds on the
previous one.

---

### **Stage 1: Attention**

**Question:** Can you drive traffic and capture attention?  
**Metric:** Daily visitors + bounce rate  
**Time:** 1-2 weeks  
**ENV:** `NUXT_PUBLIC_VALIDATION_STAGE=attention`

**Thresholds & Actions:**

| Signal      | Range     | Meaning                  | Action                                  |
| ----------- | --------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **Weak**    | <10/day   | No traffic strategy      | Learn one channel, test different hooks |
| **Average** | 10-30/day | Growing traction         | Refine messaging, optimize bounce rate  |
| **Strong**  | >30/day   | Validated traffic source | Progress to Stage 2                     |

**Decision Point:**

- Strong signal ‚Üí Move to conversion stage
- Weak signal after 4+ weeks ‚Üí Pivot traffic strategy or reconsider market
- Average signal ‚Üí Continue iterating

---

### **Stage 2: Conversion**

**Question:** Do visitors want your solution enough to exchange their email?  
**Metric:** Email capture rate (visitors ‚Üí signups)  
**Time:** 2-4 weeks  
**ENV:** `NUXT_PUBLIC_VALIDATION_STAGE=conversion`

**Thresholds & Actions:**

| Signal      | Range | Meaning             | Action                                     |
| ----------- | ----- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Weak**    | <5%   | Positioning unclear | Refine offer, test new messaging           |
| **Average** | 5-15% | Good interest       | A/B test improvements, gather feedback     |
| **Strong**  | >15%  | Strong signal       | Build the lead magnet, progress to Stage 3 |

**Decision Point:**

- Strong signal ‚Üí Build magnet and move to engagement stage
- Weak signal after 10+ tests ‚Üí Revisit positioning or pivot
- Average signal ‚Üí Continue optimizing conversion elements

---

### **Stage 3: Engagement**

**Question:** Do they complete what you deliver?  
**Metric:** Magnet completion rate (signups ‚Üí completed)  
**Time:** 2-4 weeks  
**ENV:** `NUXT_PUBLIC_VALIDATION_STAGE=engagement`

**Thresholds & Actions:**

| Signal      | Range  | Meaning             | Action                                       |
| ----------- | ------ | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Weak**    | <20%   | Content lacks value | Improve magnet quality, shorten content      |
| **Average** | 20-40% | Decent engagement   | Refine delivery, add more value              |
| **Strong**  | >40%   | High completion     | Schedule feedback calls, progress to Stage 4 |

**Decision Point:**

- Strong signal ‚Üí Schedule calls with completers, move to demand stage
- Weak signal ‚Üí Content mismatch, rebuild magnet based on feedback
- Average signal ‚Üí Optimize delivery and follow-up sequence

---

### **Stage 4: Demand**

**Question:** Will they pay for a solution to their next pain point?  
**Metric:** Purchase intent rate (completers ‚Üí expressed interest)  
**Time:** 2-4 weeks  
**ENV:** `NUXT_PUBLIC_VALIDATION_STAGE=demand`

**Thresholds & Actions:**

| Signal      | Range  | Meaning                    | Action                                   |
| ----------- | ------ | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Weak**    | <10%   | Offer misaligned           | Revisit pain points, adjust pricing      |
| **Average** | 10-20% | Some interest              | Refine offer packaging, test pricing     |
| **Strong**  | >20%   | Strong monetization signal | Close initial sales, progress to Stage 5 |

**Decision Point:**

- Strong signal ‚Üí Start building full product/service, move to build stage
- Weak signal ‚Üí Offer doesn't solve real pain point, pivot or abandon
- Average signal ‚Üí Continue optimizing offer and pricing

---

### **Stage 5: Build Prep**

**Question:** Can you optimize the full funnel and scale confidently?  
**Metric:** Full-funnel conversion (visitors ‚Üí paying customers)  
**Time:** Ongoing  
**ENV:** `NUXT_PUBLIC_VALIDATION_STAGE=build_prep`

**Thresholds & Actions:**

| Signal      | Range | Meaning                  | Action                                    |
| ----------- | ----- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Weak**    | <1%   | Funnel leaks             | Identify drop-off points, optimize stages |
| **Average** | 1-3%  | Solid foundation         | Continue optimization, add testimonials   |
| **Strong**  | >3%   | Validated business model | Scale traffic with confidence             |

**Focus Areas:**

- Optimize all previous stages (attention ‚Üí demand)
- Add testimonials and social proof
- Create media assets (demo videos, case studies)
- Refine messaging based on validated feedback
- Scale traffic and optimize conversion at each stage

---

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/incubrain/product-validator your-project
cd your-project

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Copy example environment file
cp example.env .env

# Start dev server
pnpm dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see placeholder site.

---

### Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Setup environment variables** - Copy `example.env` to `.env` (local) or
   configure in your deployment provider's environment settings
2. **Replace placeholder content** in `shared/config/` files
3. **Setup analytics** (Umami pre-configured, swap easily via
   [Nuxt Scripts](https://scripts.nuxt.com/scripts))
4. **Start with Stage 1** and progress based on metrics

## üìö Configuration

All landing page content is managed through structured config files in
`shared/config/`.

### Config Files Structure

```
shared/config/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1.flow.ts               # Overall page structure & section config
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2.problem-solution.ts   # Problem/solution cards
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 4.process.ts            # 5-stage validation journey content
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 5.founder.ts            # Your story & positioning
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 6.offers.ts             # Lead magnet + paid service
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 7.results.ts            # Testimonials & social proof
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 8.concerns.ts           # FAQ & objections
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ navigation.ts           # Primary/secondary CTA configuration
```

**Progressive Disclosure:** Sections appear/hide based on your validation stage
(set via ENV), keeping focus on what matters now.
