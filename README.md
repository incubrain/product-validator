# Product Validator

> **⚠️ Validation-first Template** — Designed to answer _“Should we build it?”_

A minimal, production-ready **Nuxt 4 + Tailwind v4 + TypeScript** template to
help you validate startup ideas fast. Ship a landing page in a day, share it
widely, and learn from analytics without vendor lock-in.

## ✨ Why This Template?

Most founders overbuild. Validation is not about features — it’s about
**evidence**.  
This template removes drag, decision paralysis, and perfectionism hell so you
can focus on building a business not a ghost product!

- **Landing Page in Minutes** — clone, configure, deploy
- **Research-driven Data Model** — unified config for profiles, hypotheses,
  offers, and proof
- **Conversion Systems Baked-in** — banner CTA + exit-intent modal included
- **Four-Product Framework** — primary + magnet + direct-revenue + social
  offers, all driving to your core product
- **Nuxt Events → Any Analytics** — structured events, provider-agnostic
  (pre-configured with Umami)
- **Social-first Playbook** — prompts to share in communities and networks
- **Public Critiques on YouTube** — submit your page for review:
  [Incubrain YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@Incubrain)

We’re also **building this template in public**, using it for our own product,
and documenting the process openly on YouTube.

## 🧩 What’s Inside

- **Profiles + Hypotheses** — capture audience pains, outcomes, and evidence
  before you build
- **Offers + Social Proof** — structured to map directly to pricing and
  credibility components
- **Conversion UX** — CTA banner + exit intent to maximize early signal
- **Analytics Ready** — Umami integration plus provider-agnostic event system
- **Developer-Friendly** — Nuxt 4, Tailwind v4, TypeScript, Tailwind Variants
