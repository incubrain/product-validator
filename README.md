> **⚠️ Validation-first Template** — Designed to answer _“Should we build it?”_

## ✨ Why This Template?

Most founders overbuild. Validation is not about features — it’s about
**evidence**.  
This template removes drag, decision paralysis, and perfectionism hell so you
can focus on building a business not a ghost product!

- **Landing Page in Minutes** — clone, configure, deploy
- **Research-driven Data Model** — unified config for profiles, hypotheses,
  offers, and proof
- **Conversion Systems Baked-in** — banner CTA + exit-intent modal included
- **Four-Product Framework** — primary + magnet + direct-revenue + social
  offers, all driving to your core product
- **Nuxt Events → Any Analytics** — structured events, provider-agnostic
  (pre-configured with Umami)
- **Social-first Playbook** — prompts to share in communities and networks
- **Public Critiques on YouTube** — submit your page for review:

We’re also **building this template in public**, using it for our own product,
and documenting the process openly on YouTube.
