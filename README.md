# Product Validator

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Validation-first Template** ‚Äî Ship a landing page in <1 hour, validate in
> weeks, not months.

A minimal, production-ready **Nuxt 4 + Tailwind v4 + TypeScript** template
designed to help struggling founders break perfectionist cycles and validate
ideas through action.

**Core Philosophy:** You are the product. You are the customer. Ship signal, not
perfection.

## ‚ú® Why This Template Exists

Most founders get stuck in perfectionist loops:

- "Just one more feature..."
- "I need to research more first..."
- "It's not ready to show anyone yet..."

**This template forces a different path:**

1. **Deploy with placeholders** (break the "not ready" barrier)
2. **AI-guided introspection** (discover what you're uniquely positioned to
   build)
3. **Package your offer** (structure your Launch Kit based on your positioning)
4. **Ship real content** (replace placeholders with validated messaging)
5. **Get feedback** (recorded YouTube critique + strategic guidance)

**Total time investment:** 8-12 hours ‚Üí Live validated landing page

## üìö Documentation

### Guides (For Founders)

**Getting Started:**

- [Step 1: Deployment](guides/1.deployment.md) ‚Äî Get live with placeholders
  in <1 hour
- [FilloutForm Setup](guides/fillout-setup.md) ‚Äî Automate your Launch Kit email
  sequence

**After Launch Kit Completion:**

- [Step 4: Configuration](guides/step-4-configuration.md) ‚Äî Replace placeholders
  with AI-generated content
- [Analytics Setup](guides/analytics-setup.md) ‚Äî Track conversions (setup AFTER
  feedback call)

### System Prompts (AI Guides)

Attached to Launch Kit emails, used in your AI project
(ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini/Grok):

- **Step 2:** Introspection Guide (deep positioning discovery)
- **Step 3:** Positioning + Offer Packaging (competitive analysis)
- **Step 4:** Config Generation (transform context into production files)

### Configuration

All landing page content is managed through structured config files in
`shared/config/`.

**To customize your site:** Update the config files with your content. Each file
has inline comments explaining what it needs and where that information comes
from (Step 2 or 3 of the Launch Kit).

**After completing the Launch Kit:** AI will generate completed config files
based on your introspection and positioning work. Simply copy them into your
codebase and deploy.

## üéØ Who This Is For

**Ideal for:**

- Technical founders stuck in "almost ready" mode for 3-10+ years
- Founders with domain expertise but can't identify what to build
- Those who keep rebuilding instead of validating
- People tired of perfectionist loops preventing launches

**Not ideal for:**

- Post-PMF companies scaling existing products
- B2B enterprise with long sales cycles
- Non-technical founders without dev support
- Anyone expecting passive validation without marketing effort

---

## üèóÔ∏è Why This Approach Works

### Email Sequence (Not PDFs/Videos)

- Fastest format to deliver value
- No production overhead (write text, automate delivery)
- Progressive value delivery (each step builds on previous)
- Easy to iterate based on feedback

### AI-Guided (Not Worksheets)

- Recognizes patterns you're too close to see
- Pushes for specificity when answers are vague
- Speech-to-text optimized (think out loud, AI extracts signal)
- Replaces expensive coaching or mastermind groups

### Placeholder-First Deployment

- Breaks perfectionism by forcing public iteration from day one
- Removes the "not ready yet" excuse
- Tests messaging before investing in design
- Psychological shift from private iteration to public learning

### Structured Config (Not CMS)

- Single-page validation doesn't need content management
- Version controlled (Git history of messaging iterations)
- Type-safe (catches errors at compile-time)
- Fast (no database queries, pure static generation)
