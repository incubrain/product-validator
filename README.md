# Product Validator

> **⚠️ Validation-first Template** — Designed to answer *“Should we build it?”*

A minimal, production-ready **Nuxt 4 + Tailwind v4 + TypeScript** template to help you validate startup ideas fast. Ship a landing page in a day, share it widely, and learn from analytics without vendor lock-in.

## ✨ Why This Template?

Most founders overbuild. Validation is not about features — it’s about **evidence**.
This template removes drag, decision paralysis, and perfectionism hell so you can focus on building a business not a ghost product!

* **Landing Page in Minutes** — clone, configure, deploy
* **Nuxt Events → Any Analytics** — structured events, provider-agnostic - pre configured with Umami Analytics
* **Social-first Playbook** — prompts to share in communities and networks
* **Public Critiques on YouTube** — submit your page for a recorded review: [Incubrain YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@Incubrain)

We’re also **building this template in public**, using it for our own product, and documenting the process openly on YouTube.
